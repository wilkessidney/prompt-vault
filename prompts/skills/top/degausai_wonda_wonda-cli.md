# Wonda CLI

Wonda CLI is a content creation toolkit for terminal-based agents. Use it to generate images, videos, music, and audio; edit and compose media; publish to social platforms; and research/automate across LinkedIn, Reddit, and X/Twitter.

## Install

If `wonda` is not found on PATH, install it first. The recommended installs are the signed desktop installers (CLI + tray icon + always-on relay, zero extra steps): macOS `brew install --cask degausai/tap/wonda-app` (or the wonda-macos.pkg from releases), Windows winget/wonda-windows-setup.exe. The CLI-only channels below work everywhere and can add the desktop app later with `wonda app install`:

```bash
# npm
npm i -g @degausai/wonda

# Homebrew
brew tap degausai/tap && brew install wonda
```

## Setup

- **Auth**: `wonda auth login` (opens browser, recommended) or set `WONDA_API_KEY` env var
- **Verify**: `wonda auth check`

### OAuth connector auth

Claude web and Cowork connectors use Wonda's OAuth 2.1 flow instead of a CLI
API key field. The connector signs in through Wonda in the browser, grants the
requested account access, and receives OAuth tokens bound to the Wonda API
resource. The server swaps those tokens to the account's internal API key only
inside Wonda, so agents and connector hosts never see the `sk_...` key. For the
CLI and local stdio MCP path, keep using `wonda auth login` or
`WONDA_API_KEY`.

### Claude Cowork local relay

Claude Cowork (the desktop app) runs local MCP servers on the host, so it can
load the `.mcpb` bundle or a local stdio `wonda-mcp` config directly, WAB
writes included (verified 2026-07-07). Claude web cannot. The Wonda local
relay is the alternative path: it lets the REMOTE connector (web or Cowork)
run actions on the user's own Mac and residential IP without any local MCP
config:

1. Open `https://wonda.sh/download` while signed in and install the notarized
   Mac package.
2. Pair the relay with `wonda relay pair` or the first-run browser handoff. This
   uses the existing `cli-auth` flow with a relay-scoped `wrelay_...`
   credential stored in the macOS Keychain. Do not ask the user to paste an API
   key or device code.
3. Open `https://wonda.sh/setup`, connect LinkedIn, X, and Reddit through the
   headful local WAB, then approve the Wonda connector once in Claude.

The engine policy is `auto | my_machine | cloud`. `auto` uses the local relay
when it is online and cloud otherwise. `my_machine` must not silently fall back:
if the relay is offline, ask whether to switch to cloud.

### Organizations & spend context

Wondercat orgs are shared wallets with their own seats and billing.
Members can spend from the org wallet (instead of their personal credits)
by switching context:

- `wonda organizations list` (aliases: `wonda orgs list`, `wonda org list`) — see every org you belong to with your role and seat plan in each.
- `wonda use --org <slug>` — sticky org context for this machine. Sets
  `X-Wonda-Org` on every request; holds, charges, and `wonda balance`
  route through the org wallet.
- `wonda use --personal` — back to personal.
- `wonda usage` — spend-only usage summary (total + per-model + per-project
  breakdown) for a period (`--month 2026-05`, or `--from`/`--to`; defaults
  to the current month, UTC). `--project <name>` restricts the report to one
  project. In org context it reports org-wide usage including a per-member
  breakdown — admin/owner role required. Admins can also download a full
  Excel report from the org page on the web.

### Projects (spend tagging)

Projects attribute spend to a named workstream for monitoring. Agents
should check the active project at task start (`wonda use` prints it) and
set one per task when the operator monitors spend by project:

- `wonda use --project <name>` — sticky: every subsequent charge carries
  the project (in `wonda usage`, the API, and the org Excel report).
  `wonda use --no-project` stops tagging; switching org/personal context
  clears the project automatically (projects are per-scope).
- `--project <name>` on any command — one-off override for that invocation.
- `wonda project list|create|delete` — manage the registry in the active
  scope. Org projects are created by org admins/owners only; personal
  projects are self-service. Tagging against a name that doesn't exist
  fails with `unknown_project` (no silent new buckets, so typos can't
  split the monitoring data).

`wonda topup` always tops up your **personal** wallet, regardless of
context. Topping up the org wallet (and configuring auto top-up) is
admin-only and happens on the web at `/organizations/<slug>`. If a
member runs out of org credits, the error tells them to ask an admin or
switch back to personal — they cannot top up the org wallet from CLI.

Roles inside an org are separate from the seat plan:

- **Owner**: the original creator. Cannot be demoted or kicked. Can transfer ownership to another member from the org page (rare).
- **Admin**: can invite (single or bulk via paste), kick, change roles, change seats, top up, configure auto top-up, change monthly limits.
- **User**: can only spend within the org wallet (subject to a per-member monthly limit if the admin set one).

A paid org seat (`WONDA` / `WONDA_PREMIUM`) grants the same paid feature access (skills, etc.) as a personal paid plan, but only while in org context. `wonda use --personal` falls back to the user's personal account plan.

### Access tiers

Wonda is paid-only: every product surface requires a paid plan, including API calls, local platform reads, browser automation, media composition, file editing, diagnostics, generation, publishing, scraping, analysis, skills, relay operation, and cloud twin. Before any product command does work, the CLI performs a live entitlement check against Wonda. The check fails closed when access cannot be verified. New accounts get no product access until they subscribe, and a positive credit balance does not substitute for a plan.

| Tier                                            | Access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anonymous** (no login)                        | No product access. Authentication, config, pricing, organization discovery/selection, shell completion, and local shutdown commands remain available so the user can subscribe, recover, or stop background services. Run `wonda auth login`, then subscribe.                       |
| **Free** (logged in, no paid plan)              | No product access. Subscribe at https://wonda.sh/account to use the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **WONDA** (`$19.99/mo`, "Pro")                  | Everything except cloud twin: generation (`image/generate`, `video/generate`, ...), media upload/download, publishing, scraping, analytics, video analysis, skills (`wonda skill install/list/get`), transitions, clipping, email, reddit/linkedin account creation, styles, brand. |
| **WONDA_PREMIUM** (`$49.99/mo`, "Premium")      | Everything in WONDA, plus **cloud twin** (`wonda twin`: provisioning, scheduled runs, streamed login) with antidetect / shadowban protection, no caps, and US account creation.                                                                                                     |
| **Flagged** (per-account PostHog kill-switches) | Included in the paid plan but still gateable by a per-account flag: `wonda reddit signup` (redditAccountCreationEnabled), `wonda email` (emailServerApiEnabled), public LinkedIn profile enrichment (linkedinProfileEnrichmentEnabled).                                             |

If a command returns a `403` (`paid_plan_required`), subscribe at https://wonda.sh/account.

This applies to the local stdio MCP path too because MCP executes the same CLI. Platform cookies and data remain on-device, but the command must first receive a successful paid-access decision from `GET /api/v1/auth/access`. A relay-only installation may use its scoped `wrelay_...` credential for that entitlement probe. The scoped credential still cannot call ordinary account APIs.

### Voice cloning

Clone a voice from a 10s+ audio clip and use it in TTS. Hard limit: 20 cloned voices per account. Cost: $1.50 per clone.

```bash
# Clone from a local file (auto-uploads to media library first)
wonda voice create "Andu" --file ./sample.mp3 --description "My voice"

# Clone from existing wonda media
wonda voice create "Brand" --media-id <uuid>

# Optional source-audio preprocessing
wonda voice create "Clean" --file ./raw.wav --noise-reduction --normalize-volume

# List cloned voices (each row reports isExpired and expiresInDays)
wonda voice list

# One voice
wonda voice get <voice-id>

# Rename / re-describe (local only, no provider call)
wonda voice update <voice-id> --name "New Name" --description "..."

# Delete
wonda voice delete <voice-id>
```

**Use a cloned voice in TTS** by passing the `providerVoiceId` from `voice get` as `voiceId` to `/audio/speech`:

```bash
wonda audio speech "Hello world" \
  --model minimax-speech-2-8-hd \
  --params '{"voiceId":"<providerVoiceId>"}'
```

**7-day expiry**: cloned voices that haven't been used in TTS within 7 days are automatically expired. Running TTS with a cloned voice automatically refreshes its expiry. Idle voices that lapse must be re-cloned ($1.50 again).

### Credentials vault

Persist logins created on external platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.) so they can be reused on the next run. Passwords are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a server-side key and only decrypted on `get`.

```bash
# Create
wonda credentials create --website instagram.com --username myhandle \
  --email me@example.com --password-stdin <<< "hunter2" \
  --metadata '{"signup_source":"wonda-email"}'

# List (passwords omitted)
wonda credentials list --website instagram.com

# Get full record including decrypted password
wonda credentials get <id>

# Update any field (use --password-stdin to rotate; --username "" to clear)
wonda credentials update <id> --username newhandle

# Delete
wonda credentials delete <id>

# Fetch + record why you're using it in one call — POST, not GET, because
# it writes a 'used' event with the reason. Prefer this over `get` whenever
# you can articulate the reason.
wonda credentials use <id> --reason "instagram signup flow"

# See recent events (created / used / rotated / updated) for audit
wonda credentials events <id>
```

Fields: `website` (required — typed input like `insta` is canonicalized to `instagram.com`), `username`, `email`, `password` (required), `metadata` (arbitrary JSON). At least one of `username` / `email` must be present. Multiple records per `(website, username)` are allowed — dedupe on your side if you need to.

**Event log**: every `credentials get`/`use`, `create`, password rotate, and other updates are recorded as events on the credential (actor: `cli` | `web` | `system`). Use `credentials events <id>` or the web UI's history icon to audit. The event log is append-only and cascades on credential delete.

### Global output flags

All commands support these output control flags:

- `--json` — Force JSON output (auto-enabled when stdout is piped)
- `--quiet` — Only output the primary identifier (job ID, media ID, etc.) — ideal for scripting
- `-o <path>` — Download output to file (implies `--wait`)
- `--fields status,outputs` — Select specific JSON fields
- `--jq '.outputs[0].media.url'` — Filter JSON output with a jq expression

### CLI announcements & deprecation warnings

On every command the CLI polls `GET /api/v1/updates` (anonymous, 1h cache in `~/.wonda/state.json`) for active announcements: deprecation notices, incident heads-ups, upgrade prompts. Messages are printed to stderr only, so stdout/JSON stays clean for piping.

Per-request deprecation hints arrive as the standard `Warning: 299 - "<message>"` HTTP header and are surfaced to stderr by the CLI's HTTP client as `[deprecated METHOD /path] <message>`.

Silence both channels with `WONDA_QUIET=1` (env var) or `--quiet` (flag). Disable just the network checks with `WONDA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### WAB / Wonda Automation Browser (`wonda wab`)

The Wonda Automation Browser (WAB) is a premium stealth antidetect browser, hardened so platforms cannot fingerprint it as automation. `wonda wab` is the one command for the antidetect Chromium stack (an undetected Playwright fork). It has two faces:

- **Authenticated sessions.** One persistent headful Chromium per persona that holds signed-in sessions for LinkedIn, X, Reddit, and friends. The CLI spawns it on demand, lets it idle out, and routes platform reads/writes through it whenever a command runs `--via wab`. Cookies live in the persona's Chromium profile, not in `~/.wonda/config.json`.
- **Anonymous capture.** `wonda wab screenshot <url>`, `wonda wab record <url>`, and `wonda brand extract` drive an ephemeral Chromium with a fresh fingerprint, no persona, and no cookies. Screenshot supports responsive single, batch, and manifest capture. See the screenshot and record blocks below.

The mental model: you have **accounts** (one identity per platform). Each platform command routes to that account's cookies via either the flat JSON store (`--via cookies`, fast, no Chromium) or the account's **persona** (`--via wab`, live antidetect Chromium). A persona is the Chromium envelope that can hold multiple accounts under one fingerprint. In almost every case the persona is auto-created on first `--via wab` use, named after the account, so you never type a persona name.

The local `wonda.mcpb` Desktop Extension uses this same local WAB path from Claude Desktop or Claude Code: platform cookies stay on-device, reads use local cookies, and writes use the local WAB. Claude web and Cowork need the remote MCP connector instead.

**Native login is the default for a new persona.** `wonda wab login <persona> <platform>` opens a headful WAB window and you log in there. The session is minted INSIDE the WAB, so it is independent (logging out of the same account in an unrelated Chrome cannot revoke it) and the cookies are born under the WAB's own fingerprint, so session and browser identity stay coherent. A brand-new persona auto-created on first `--via wab` use chains straight into this flow on a TTY. After an X login, Wonda detects the signed-in `screen_name` and records it as the persona's X account binding. Existing bindings are never silently changed; a different detected handle produces a warning. Pasting cookies from another browser (`wonda linkedin auth set`, `wonda x auth set`, ...) still works and is the explicit fallback, but a hand-pasted `li_at` on a novel WAB fingerprint is the highest-risk shape.

```bash
wonda wab install                             # one-time: npm install + stealth-browser Chromium (shared by sessions, screenshot, record, brand extract)
wonda wab update                              # refresh the runtime to the version this CLI pins (runtime versions ship inside CLI releases): staged download, verified, then atomically swapped in, so a failed download leaves the current driver tree untouched; refuses the runtime swap while personas run (wab stop them first; the relay picks the new runtime up on its next spawn, no restart), while an already-current tree's cheap manifest refresh proceeds without the gate: it reconciles drifted current files back to this build's embedded bytes (additive rewrites, safe under a running persona) and only prunes stale files when NO personas are running, deferring the prune (and keeping the mismatch visible) until the tree is quiet; --check reports installed vs pinned without changing anything, --force reinstalls even when current and re-downloads the shared Chromium build (corrupt-cache recovery; caveat: --force clears the cached Chromium before re-downloading, so a failed forced download leaves the shared cache without it until a retry succeeds). The driver tree also carries a manifest recording what produced it: the embedded driver asset identity compatibility is actually keyed on, plus the CLI build and platform as provenance. A tree whose recorded assets differ from this binary's embedded set (or that predates manifests) is refreshed automatically at the next browser spawn or wab update; two builds shipping byte-identical driver assets share one manifest without churn, so the recorded CLI version can lag behind the newest compatible binary. --check reports the manifest state (ok|absent|mismatch|unreadable) without touching anything; --json only changes the output format and still performs the update
wonda wab start [account]                     # spawn (offscreen by default; --visible to show)
wonda wab stop [account]                      # graceful shutdown
wonda wab show [account]                       # peek a background WAB on-screen to watch it (suspends the macOS focus guard); starts it offscreen first if needed
wonda wab hide [account]                       # send a surfaced WAB back offscreen, resume silent background operation
wonda wab screenshot [persona]                 # persona mode: capture an already-open tab without surfacing it; --json still returns inline base64, --output writes a file, --tab/--full-page optional
wonda wab screenshot <url> --output page.png   # anonymous PNG in a fresh ephemeral browser; responsive waits, injection, animation, element, clip, batch, manifest, and diagnostic JSON controls, see below
wonda wab browse [url] --persona <persona>     # load a page and scroll it like a person: pause, scroll, pause, scroll; stops early once the scrolled element stops advancing, see below (plain text output, not JSON)
wonda wab menubar                              # Tray control, macOS menu bar or Windows notification area: the Wonda cat icon with a corner status badge. Green filled = running here and serving; orange half = standing by, which proves only that this machine is not the active device (whether another device or no device is serving is a separate three-way the badge cannot answer, and the menu's detail line only echoes the last relay-health check, a snapshot that can lag while this machine stays in standby); red triangle = running but cannot serve; grey hollow = not running here. The badge carries shape as well as color (filled/half/triangle/hollow) on both platforms; macOS falls back to a 🐱 text item with the same states as glyphs. Click for Restart Relay, a state-following Stop/Start toggle (`wonda relay disable`/`enable`, never `relay stop`), Open Log (macOS only; the Windows task runs the relay with no log file), and Show/Hide per running WAB; the tooltip carries the full status sentence. The bottom item "Quit Wonda" runs `wonda app quit` (stop relay + disable autostart + remove every open-at-login mechanism (macOS login item, Windows Startup entry) + remove the icon; quit stays quit until the app or `wonda app open` runs again). The Windows tray is a PowerShell/WinForms NotifyIcon consuming `relay health --json` (state) plus a periodic `wab status --json` (the persona Show/Hide list) and shelling wonda verbs, zero platform logic in the script. --stop removes only the icon and leaves the relay running
# macOS Dock menu: right-click a running WAB's Dock tile (the 🐱) for "Show on screen" / "Send to background" (same as wab show/hide). Each running persona has its own Dock tile and its menu controls only that persona. Opt out with WAB_DOCK_MENU=0.
# macOS: a background WAB no longer steals focus or flashes the menu bar / Dock when it opens a new tab; the Dock tile stays, it just never comes to the foreground until you `wab show` it.
wonda wab status                              # list personas + last activity + browser-context health (a running daemon whose Chromium died shows browser-dead with a restart hint instead of a misleading plain "running")
wonda wab login <account> <linkedin|x|reddit|instagram> # RECOMMENDED for a new persona: open headful window, user logs in, session minted in-WAB (independent + fingerprint-coherent)

wonda wab bundle-failures prune               # remove bundles older than 30d (or --max-per-persona, --all)
# Telemetry: on every wab action failure we report (action, platform, reason, error-string, has_bundle, cli_version) as a wab_action_failed PostHog event so maintainers can spot platform rotations across users. NO bundle contents, NO cookies, NO DOM, NO screenshots leave the user's machine. Opt out: WONDA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1. For server-side breakdowns, group `wab_action_failed` by `platform`, `action`, `reason`, and `has_bundle` in PostHog. Locally, `wonda wab top-failures` reads only `~/.wonda/wab/errors.jsonl` and persona-local `dom-recoveries.jsonl`, then shows count, last seen, recovered rate, bundle count, and a sample bundle id.

wonda wab config set <persona> <key> <value>  # persist per-persona spawn defaults (idle-timeout, locale, visible, interactive, proxy_url, timezone, geo_lat/lon)
wonda wab config get <persona>                # print a persona's persisted config
```

**Keep cron personas warm.** A persona that continuously backs cookie-only read crons can use `wonda wab config set <persona> idle-timeout off`, followed by `wonda wab start <persona>`. The WAB then stays up and its existing 10-minute cookie sync keeps the flat files current. Use always-on only for cron-backing personas; `wonda wab config unset <persona> idle-timeout` restores the default 30-minute idle shutdown.

**Local browser proxy (`proxy_url`).** By default the local WAB dials direct (your own IP). Set `wonda wab config set <persona> proxy_url managed` to route the LOCAL browser through your account's minted twin proxy, so it shares the same egress as the cloud twin (useful for IP continuity or a VPN/office/CGNAT network). A literal `socks5://…`/`https://…` value is a manual override instead; unset clears it back to direct. The proxy is optional: if minting is disabled for the environment or unavailable, the browser falls back to a direct dial.

Lifecycle commands take an `--account` (e.g. `wonda wab login <account> linkedin`); the persona is auto-derived from the account name. `wonda wab bind` is the one place a persona is named explicitly: use it when one Chromium must host accounts that have different names per platform.

**Scroll a page like a person (`browse`).** `wonda wab browse [url] --persona <persona>` loads a page in the persona's WAB and scrolls it: a pause to look at the page, then scroll, pause, scroll, for `--scrolls` times (default `5`). `--scrolls` accepts `1`-`200`; a value outside that range is a hard error, not clamped, and it is rejected before a browser is launched. `--first-wait` (default `10s`) is the pause before the first scroll; `--wait` (default `5s`) is the pause between scrolls; both are jittered +/-30% because a precisely repeated interval is itself a fingerprint, and both are floored at 250ms so a very small value is not jittered down to zero — `--first-wait 0 --wait 0` still pauses ~250ms per wait, not 0, so with `--scrolls 200` that floor alone adds up to roughly 50s. It only scrolls — no clicking, no engagement — so it works on any site.

Progress is measured on the element that was actually scrolled: the viewport-filling overflow container when the site has one (LinkedIn's feed lives in `<main id="workspace">`, where `window.scrollY` never moves at all), otherwise the document scroller. Scrolling stops early once that element stops advancing across 2 consecutive scrolls, reported as `(reached bottom)` in the printed summary, so a short page does not grind against the bottom. An infinite feed keeps going for the full `--scrolls`.

`--persona` falls back to your configured default account exactly like the other `wonda wab` commands, and an invalid persona name is rejected up front instead of silently creating an empty logged-out profile. With a url, `browse` navigates in its OWN isolated tab (like every other WAB write) and reports the page actually browsed (after any redirect). Omitting the url dispatches to the persona's shared **default** tab instead — the driver's initial page, the same tab id `wonda wab show`/`hide` reference — scrolling whatever that tab already shows. `wonda wab login` does NOT leave anything there: it opens and navigates its own separate `<platform>-login` tab, so a persona that was just logged in still has an untouched default tab (often still `about:blank`). `wonda wab show`/`hide` don't navigate the default tab either — they only toggle the window's on/off-screen visibility — so neither one "opens a page" there. What actually leaves a page on default is something that navigates it directly, e.g. `wonda wab start --open <platform|url>` (also what the MCP `wab_open` tool calls). **This is NOT a way to continue a page from a previous `wonda wab browse <url>` run**: that run navigated in its own isolated tab, which the no-url form never sees. If the default tab has no page open (`about:blank`) — the common case right after logging a new persona in, since login's tab is separate — the command fails and asks for a url rather than reporting a successful scroll of nothing.

`browse` prints a plain-text summary, not JSON, so the global `--json` / `--fields` / `--jq` flags do not apply to it.

```bash
wonda wab browse https://example.com --persona <persona> --scrolls 6
wonda wab browse --persona <persona>                      # scroll the shared default tab's current page, no navigation
```

**Anonymous PNG capture (`screenshot`).** `wonda wab screenshot` has a compatibility-preserving persona mode and a new anonymous URL mode.

`wonda wab screenshot [persona]` still captures the persona's already-open tab without surfacing the window. Its existing flags retain their meaning: `--tab` selects the tab, `--full-page` captures the scrollable page, and `--output` writes a file. With `--json` and no output file it still returns `{path, base64, mimeType}` so MCP and existing automation receive the inline PNG unchanged.

An absolute `http://` or `https://` argument selects anonymous mode. It launches a fresh ephemeral Chromium with no persona, cookies, or persistent state:

```bash
wonda wab screenshot \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8765/hero-lab.html#close-colorflight' \
  --output tmp/close-proof.png \
  --viewport 2048x982 \
  --scale 1 \
  --wait-until networkidle \
  --wait-for '#hero-preview' \
  --delay 700ms \
  --animations disabled
```

Anonymous defaults are `--viewport 1280x720`, `--scale 1`, `--wait-until networkidle`, `--delay 0`, and `--animations allow`. `--wait-until` accepts `load`, `domcontentloaded`, or `networkidle`. Wonda automatically waits for `document.fonts.ready`; `--wait-for <selector>` waits for a visible element, and `--delay <duration>` adds a final settling delay. `--inject-js <file>` runs after navigation in an async IIFE, so top-level `await` works.

For deterministic motion, use `--animations disabled` to finish finite animations and cancel infinite ones at capture, or `--freeze-at 800ms` to seek Web Animations to an exact timeline offset and pause them. The two options conflict. `--selector '.hero-stage'` captures the first matching element. `--clip x,y,width,height` captures an exact document-coordinate rectangle in CSS pixels. The rectangle may extend beyond the viewport but must fit within the rendered page. `--selector`, `--clip`, and `--full-page` are mutually exclusive capture modes.

Pass several absolute URLs to capture all of them. Or pass relative path, query, or quoted hash arguments after one absolute base URL; when any relative target is present, the first URL is only the resolution base and is not captured separately. Add `--viewports` for a viewport matrix. Chromium launches once for the whole batch:

```bash
wonda wab screenshot http://127.0.0.1:8765/hero-lab.html \
  '#fast-close' '#close-colorflight' \
  --viewports 2048x982,1440x1000,390x844 \
  --output tmp/qa \
  --output-template '{route}-{viewport}.png'
```

For a single capture without `--output-template`, `--output` is the PNG path. For a batch, manifest, or any template-driven capture, it is an output directory. `--output-template` supports `{index}`, `{route}`, and `{viewport}`, and expanded paths must be unique. `{route}` is sanitized; overlong expanded path components are shortened with a stable hash suffix. `--viewport` and `--viewports` conflict. Without output flags, one URL writes `screenshot-<timestamp>.png` in the current directory and a batch writes under `screenshots-<timestamp>/`. A template without `--output` is relative to the current directory, or to the manifest directory when it comes from the manifest.

A strict JSON manifest describes the same matrix:

```json
{
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/hero-lab.html",
  "routes": ["#fast-close", "#close-colorflight"],
  "viewports": ["2048x982", "1440x1000", "390x844"],
  "scale": 1,
  "waitUntil": "networkidle",
  "waitFor": "#hero-preview",
  "delay": "700ms",
  "injectJs": "scripts/visual-state.mjs",
  "animations": "disabled",
  "outputTemplate": "{route}-{viewport}.png"
}
```

Run it with `wonda wab screenshot --manifest visual-qa.json --output tmp/qa`. Use `urls` instead of `url` for independent absolute targets; `routes` resolves relative to `url`. Manifest keys mirror the anonymous scalar flags in camel case, including `freezeAt`, `selector`, `clip`, and `fullPage`. Explicit CLI flags override manifest values.

Anonymous `--json` returns `{ok, captures: [...]}` without embedding PNG bytes. Every capture reports `url`, `finalUrl`, `viewport`, `dpr`, `pageDimensions`, `consoleErrors`, `failedRequests`, and `fontsLoaded`. A successful capture also reports `path`, which means the PNG was written there. A failed capture omits `path`, carries `error`, and keeps any diagnostics collected before the failure. The browser continues the remaining matrix after an item fails and exits nonzero when any capture failed. Use this output for visual QA diagnostics. Non-JSON output prints only successfully generated PNG paths.

**Anonymous video capture (`record`).** `wonda wab record <url>` records a URL to webm in an ephemeral Chromium (fresh fingerprint each call, no persona, no cookies). Use it for cookie-banner-gated pages (Notion public shares, pdf.js renders, any site where bare Playwright trips a bot check) and marketing demo capture.

```bash
wonda wab record https://example.notion.site/page \
  --output recording.webm \
  --duration 5 \
  --viewport 960x1080 \
  --inject-js scripts/page-script.mjs   # optional: runs after load, before timer starts

# Transcode webm to mp4 at 30 fps (the stealth browser records webm/VP8)
ffmpeg -y -i recording.webm -t 5 -r 30 -an \
  -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 recording.mp4
```

The `--inject-js` file is wrapped in an async IIFE so top-level `await` works. It runs AFTER `domcontentloaded` + `networkidle` + 400 ms paint settle, BEFORE the duration timer starts. Any `await` inside counts against the recording window. Use it for dark-theme injection, cookie-banner removal, scroll animations, anything that needs to happen in page context.

Node.js requirement: wonda needs Node >= v20 on PATH. Brew users get it via the `node` dependency; npm users have it by definition; install.sh users may need `brew install node` (or any Node distribution). If Node is missing, `wonda wab install` fetches a private copy into `~/.wonda/node/`.

**Cookie cloud backup.** On by default (opt out per machine with `wonda wab backup disable`). The WAB driver pushes the synced cookie JSON for each bound platform to the wondercat backend after every wab → disk sync and graceful shutdown; auto-push no-ops when no api_key is configured. Encrypted at rest server-side (AES-256-GCM) when `SOCIAL_COOKIES_KEY` is set, else plaintext jsonb; the wire payload is always plaintext because the server holds the key. Cookie values are never printed by list/status/port commands.

Recovery is guarded. `wonda wab backup pull <account>` and `wonda wab cookies port <platform> <persona> [account]` refuse to overwrite a non-empty or newer local cookie file unless `--force` is passed. Forced writes create a hidden `.before-pull-*` backup first. Use `--dry-run` to inspect planned writes. When the backend exposes multiple device rows for the same platform/persona/account, use `wonda wab cookies port ... --from-device <id|label>` so the source row is explicit.

Current backend compatibility: legacy servers still expose one last-write-wins row per `(account, platform, persona, account_label)`. Newer servers may include `device_id`, `device_label`, `source`, `status`, `generation`, and `provenance`; the CLI displays those fields when present and shows legacy rows as device `legacy`.

Source lives at `cli/wondercat/wab/`. The driver is `launch.mjs` and per-platform action scripts under `actions/<platform>/`.

WAB reads fail early when the selected browser profile has no live platform session cookie. For LinkedIn, X, Reddit, and Instagram, the error includes `wonda wab login <persona> <platform>` instead of surfacing an unexplained platform 401/403. This preflight is read-only; writes retain their existing error handling and native login itself is unaffected.

**Per-command transport (`--via`).** `linkedin`, `x`, and `reddit` commands take:

- `--via cookies|wab`: `cookies` reads the flat per-account JSON store (fast, no Chromium); `wab` routes through the account's persona Chromium (cookies + TLS fingerprint inherit from a real browser session). An unsupported value errors loudly rather than silently downgrading.
- `--via public`: paid public-data API where a command explicitly supports it. For LinkedIn this avoids logged-in cookies and WAB profile reads, and uses the public scrape task route for `wonda linkedin profile` and `wonda linkedin enrich`.
- `--account <name>`: which on-disk identity to use (cookie filename / persona). Persona resolution is implicit: the first `--via wab` use auto-creates a persona named after the account and (on a TTY) chains straight into login.

**Defaults differ for reads vs writes.** Read commands (profile, posts, search, timeline, etc.) default to `cookies` (direct API), because that path is fast and detection-safe. Write / engagement commands (post, comment, like, follow, connect, message, mute, repost, delete) default to `wab`, because the cookie-API path triggers anti-abuse heuristics on LinkedIn / X / Reddit at any meaningful volume. Pass `--via cookies` to a write command if you explicitly want the legacy API path (where the command supports it).

**Commands that require `--via wab`.** A few commands have no cookie path and only run through the Wonda Automation Browser: `wonda linkedin comment`, `wonda linkedin reply-comment`, `wonda linkedin mute`, `wonda linkedin follow`, `wonda linkedin edit-post`, `wonda linkedin edit-comment`, `wonda linkedin delete-comment`, `wonda linkedin post --media`, `wonda x delete`, `wonda x reply --attach`, `wonda x dm send`, `wonda x dm accept`, and `wonda x dm start`. On these, the default already resolves to wab (one stderr line noting it); passing `--via cookies` explicitly errors. Reddit's writes (`vote`, `comment`, `subscribe`, `save`, `unsave`, `delete`, and subreddit `submit`) are likewise wab-only.

**Where it runs (`--engine`).** `--via` picks the transport (browser vs. cookies); `--engine` picks the location, and the two are orthogonal. Values: `local` (this machine's WAB), `cloud` (the account's cloud twin, reached through the twin-action API with the control-session warm-up hidden behind a blocking wait), or `auto` (the default). `auto` resolves to `local` when the identity lives on this machine and `cloud` when it only exists as a cloud twin (a persona with no local footprint, or one cached as `home=cloud` from `wonda twin provision`). So `wonda linkedin posts <profile> --account <twin> --engine cloud --via wab` returns recent posts through the cloud twin's browser with the same structured result as the local command. `--via` works the same on both engines: reads default to `cookies`, writes default to `wab`, and an explicit supported override is preserved. Wired for LinkedIn (`posts`, `connect`, `like`/`unlike`, `comment`, `reply-comment`, `edit-comment`, `send-message`, `follow`, `mute`, `delete-post`, `edit-post`), X (`like`/`unlike`, `bookmark`, `retweet`/`unretweet`, `follow`/`unfollow`, `delete`), Reddit (`vote`, `subscribe`, `save`/`unsave`, `delete`), and Instagram (`comment`); other verbs run local only. `--engine` is accepted at the platform level (so both `linkedin --engine cloud posts` and `linkedin posts --engine cloud` work) but honored only on the wired verbs; passing it to another read or an unwired write is a clear error, not a silent no-op. **`wonda twin run-action` is deprecated in favor of `<platform> <verb> --engine cloud`** (it still works so running agents are not broken). On cloud, `like` supports plain likes and reactions (`--reaction`, routed to the `react` action); only comment reactions (`--comment`) stay local for now. `auto` resolves to local when a persona has no local footprint and no cloud twin (so first-use auto-create still works), and to cloud when a cloud twin exists for it. An explicit `--engine cloud` always runs on the cloud twin and never falls back to a live local relay.

**Per-account credentials.** Cookies live in per-account JSON files on disk:

- `~/.wonda/x-cookies/<account>.json`
- `~/.wonda/reddit-cookies/<account>.json`
- `~/.wonda/linkedin-cookies/<account>.json` (auto-migrated from the legacy single-file format)

Each file is a session-owned local cache, not a portable credential. A platform account may have separate sessions on multiple computers and a cloud Twin. The file records the owning device/persona WAB session, and every injection, overwrite, cookie-only read, refresh, and backup restore checks that identity first. The CLI does not upload these cookies to or download them from the legacy shared hosted-token store. `--force` never bypasses a session mismatch.

Pass `--account <name>` to `auth set` to keep multiple logins side-by-side on the current device. The binding is recorded against the resolved account persona in `account-bindings.json`, even when `--persona` is omitted, and if the matching persona's Chromium is running, the rotated cookies get pushed into that live context. Never use `auth set` to copy cookies from another device or a Twin. Native `wab login` is safer. The driver also syncs cookies back to disk every 10 minutes (and on graceful shutdown), so rotated cookies (ct0 cycles, token_v2 server-side refresh, etc.) flow back to the cookies path without manual re-paste. Direct X cookie requests also absorb response cookie rotation into the same store and send the full stored cookie jar, preserving device-trust cookies across reads.

The cloud Twin is its own stable, always-on session. Ordinary provisioning does not seed LinkedIn from local cookie files; use `wonda twin login <persona> --platform linkedin` to log in inside the Twin. Cloud backups are recovery artifacts for their source session only. Inspect local and cloud ownership with `wonda wab cookies status [persona]`; it never prints cookie values. Recent LinkedIn posts have a direct structured cloud path: `wonda linkedin posts <profile> --persona <persona> --engine cloud --via wab`. Other reads that are not yet engine-wired can run inside the Twin with `wonda twin run-now <persona> --command "<platform read command>"`; retrieve the captured result with `wonda twin output <twinRunId>`, using the id returned by run-now. Neither path downloads Twin cookies locally.

**Safely refresh LinkedIn's flat cookie file.** Run `wonda linkedin auth refresh --account <account> --persona <persona>` before a cookie-only read batch. Fresh disk cookies are a fast local no-op. Stale or near-expiry cookies cause one WAB start (a no-op when already running), one WAB-to-disk sync, and a local/WAB-side LinkedIn session check. The refresh path never invokes the raw `wonda linkedin auth check` probe and never retries credentials. If the WAB session is dead, it exits nonzero with `native re-login required`; stop the batch and recover manually with `wonda wab login <persona> linkedin`.

`wonda linkedin auth refresh --json` returns `{fresh, refreshed, ageSeconds, expiresAt, sessionAlive}`. `fresh` describes the final disk state; `refreshed` is true only when WAB-to-disk sync ran; `ageSeconds` is the disk cookie age; `expiresAt` is the known expiry or null; and `sessionAlive` is the local/WAB-side login result. `sessionAlive` is null on a fresh local no-op because no WAB check was needed. `--fresh-within` changes both the maximum accepted disk age and the minimum remaining recorded `li_at` lifetime (15 minutes by default). Treat a nonzero exit as authoritative even with JSON output.

Cookie-backed LinkedIn reads accept opt-in `--freshen` alongside `--via cookies`. It runs the same local preflight only when the disk cookies are stale, then attempts the requested read once. The default remains unchanged: without `--freshen`, `--via cookies` stays fast and browser-free.

**Safely refresh X's flat cookie file.** `wonda x auth refresh --account <account> --persona <persona>` uses the same local-first lifecycle with X-specific freshness rules. Since `auth_token` has no locally readable expiry claim, freshness is the cookie store age only. A store newer than `--fresh-within` (15 minutes by default) is a browser-free no-op. A stale store starts the selected WAB if needed, syncs X cookies to disk, and checks the WAB-side session without invoking the raw `x auth check` probe. A dead session exits nonzero with the exact native login command.

`wonda x auth refresh --json` returns `{fresh, refreshed, ageSeconds, sessionAlive}`. Cookie-backed X reads accept opt-in `--freshen`; it runs the same refresh only when the selected disk store is stale, pins the read to the refreshed account, and never applies to WAB reads, writes, or auth commands.

Use `wonda x auth status --account <name>` for a pure-local view of cookie origin, latest capture provenance, generation, ownership, cookie names, and missing device-trust-cookie risk. It never contacts X and never prints cookie values. Use `wonda x browser-bootstrap --account <name>` to explicitly push the selected stored jar into running WAB personas bound to that account.

### Action rate limits

Every platform command (`linkedin`, `x`, `reddit`, `instagram`), reads AND writes, runs through a per-profile rate-limit guard so a burst doesn't trip a platform's shadow-ban / anti-abuse heuristics. Accounting is per `(platform, account)` in a rolling 24h window, logged per profile under `~/.wonda/wab/personas/<persona>/` (so a cloud twin's caps persist across runs).

- **Reads** are _paced_, never blocked: spacing is jittered to keep a profile under `read_per_min` (75/min default), holding across separate invocations.
- **Writes** are checked against per-bucket daily caps. The LinkedIn defaults (other platforms track + count toward the total/day but have no per-type write cap by default):

  | bucket                   | commands                              | safe        | max |
  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
  | outreach                 | `connect` + `send-message` + `inmail` | 20          | 40  |
  | post                     | `post`                                | 3           | 5   |
  | comment                  | `comment`, `reply-comment`            | 10          | 20  |
  | react                    | `like`                                | 25          | 50  |
  | visit                    | `visit`                               | 15          | 30  |
  | search                   | `search`, `search-posts`              | 25          | 50  |
  | **total** (all non-read) | any of the above                      | warn at 90% | 100 |

`salesnav search` (Sales Navigator) is exempt: it carries no Commercial Use Limit, so it paces as an uncapped read instead of counting toward the `search` cap or the total/day.

Caps are **SOFT by default**: an over-safe / over-max action prints a shadow-ban-risk warning to stderr and **proceeds**. Pass `--hard` (or set `mode: hard` in config) to make over-cap writes **abort** (exit 1) instead.

`wonda actions` is a JSON data query (not a dashboard) for reading a profile's rolling-24h usage vs caps on demand; the caps/pacing/warnings run silently in the live hook regardless.

```bash
wonda actions                        # rolling-24h usage per profile vs caps, as JSON
wonda actions --persona <persona>        # one profile
wonda actions --platform linkedin    # filter to one platform
wonda linkedin quota                 # planning view: remaining LinkedIn allowance per bucket (used vs safe/max + remaining, incl. untouched buckets) BEFORE a big pull, instead of hitting the mid-output warnings
wonda actions sync                   # flush local action/health events to your Wonda account
wonda actions sync --persona <persona>   # flush one profile's ledgers
wonda linkedin post "…" --hard       # enforce caps as hard limits for this command
```

When an API key is configured, the local ledgers (actions log, WAB audit/error logs, cookie provenance) also sync to your Wonda account-health record automatically in the background on every command: best-effort, batched, and idempotent (a stable client event id per record means retries never double count), so offline use keeps working and sync catches up later. `wonda actions sync` forces a full flush and prints the server's insert/dedup counts; without an API key it is a silent no-op. Only event metadata travels, never cookie values or failure bundles. `WONDA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` turns the background sync off.

Override / disable / hard-mode via `~/.wonda/config.json` under `action_limits` (caps are clamped to safety floors/ceilings so an override can loosen but not silently disable the guard):

```json
{
  "action_limits": {
    "mode": "hard",
    "read_per_min": 75,
    "total_per_day": 100,
    "buckets": { "linkedin": { "outreach": { "safe": 15, "max": 30 } } }
  }
}
```

### Config keys

`wonda config get|set|list` keys:

- `api-key`: your wondercat API key.
- `base-url`: API base (defaults to prod, set to `https://staging.api.wondercat.ai` for staging).
- `default-account`: account used when a platform command doesn't pass `--account`.
- `wab-backup-enabled`: `true`/`false` for cookie cloud backup (same as `wonda wab backup enable`/`disable`). On by default; only an explicit `false` disables it.

Transport is NOT a config key. Each command picks it per kind (reads default to `cookies`, writes / engagement default to `wab`), identically on every platform. Override it per command with `--via cookies|wab` (where the platform supports it).

## How to think about content creation

You are a marketing director with access to a full production toolkit. Before touching any tool, think:

1. **What product category?** (beauty, food, tech, fashion, fitness, etc.)
2. **What format performs for this category?** (UGC memes for everyday products, cinematic for luxury, before/after for transformations, testimonial for services)
3. **What's the hook?** (relatable scenario, surprising twist, aspirational lifestyle, social proof)
4. **What specific scene?** (not "product on table" but "person discovering the product in a funny situation")

## Decision flow

When asked to create content, follow this order:

### Step 1: Gather context

```bash
wonda brand                                                    # Active brand: identity, colors, fonts, logos, products
wonda brand list                                               # All brands owned by this account/org
wonda brand show <brand-id>                                    # Specific brand
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com                         # Local-only: writes ./output/stripe.com/{DESIGN.md, tokens.json, assets/}
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --save --make-active    # Local + persist + activate (the common path)
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --save --name "Stripe"  # Persist with a custom name
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --no-output --save      # Don't write to disk, persist only
wonda brand save                                               # Persist the most recent ./output/<domain>/ dir to the server
wonda brand save --from ./output/stripe.com --make-active
wonda brand pull <brand-id>                                    # Download a saved brand back to ./output/<domain>/
wonda brand activate <brand-id>                                # Set as the active brand
wonda brand upload-logo <brand-id> https://acme.com/logo.svg   # Attach a logo by URL (--variant wordmark|icon|dark|light)
wonda brand upload-font <brand-id> https://acme.com/Geist.woff2 --weight 700
wonda brand delete <brand-id>
wonda analytics instagram                                      # What content performs well
wonda scrape social --handle @competitor --platform instagram --wait  # Competitive research (if relevant)

# Cross-platform research (if relevant)
wonda x search "topic OR keyword"                              # Find conversations on X/Twitter
wonda x user-tweets @competitor                                # Competitor's recent tweets
wonda reddit search "topic" --sort top --time week             # Reddit discussions
wonda reddit feed marketing --sort hot                         # Subreddit trends
wonda linkedin search "topic" --type COMPANIES                 # LinkedIn company/people research
wonda linkedin profile competitor-vanity-name                  # LinkedIn profile intel
```

### Step 2: Check content skills

Content skills are step-by-step guides for common content types. Each skill tells you exactly which models, prompts, and editing operations to use — and in what order. ALWAYS check skills before building from scratch.

Skills are **server-hosted, per-account, and editable** (the same model as `wonda brand save`) — you don't download a folder of `.md` files you own. Wonda ships a canonical set of **default** skills, served read-only as the fallback. Pull them live for a task; fork a default into your own copy when you want to tweak it; Wonda keeps full version history. `skill list` shows your effective skills (defaults overlaid with your own edits), and flags any fork whose default has since changed.

```bash
wonda skill list                                # Browse your effective skills (defaults + your own); forks with a changed default are flagged
wonda skill get <slug>                          # Pull a skill's full step-by-step guide live to stdout
```

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->

**Default skill catalog** (live source: `wonda skill list`, which also shows your own forks/edits and flags drift):

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_END -->

**Editing skills (optional).** When a default doesn't quite fit, fork and edit it instead of working around it. Editing a default forks it into your account automatically:

```bash
wonda skill create my-ugc --from ugc-talking    # Fork a default into your own editable copy
wonda skill edit my-ugc --editor                # Record a new version (opens $EDITOR; or --file <md> / stdin)
wonda skill diff <slug>                          # See what changed in the default since you forked it (drift)
wonda skill refactor <slug> --editor             # Re-base your fork onto the updated default, clears the drift hint
```

**If a skill matches** → `wonda skill get <slug>`, read it, adapt to context, execute each step.

**If no skill matches** → build from scratch (Step 3).

### Step 2.5: Decide whether finishing should be local

Not every media task should go back through Wonda editing. Use this routing rule:

- Use `wonda` for AI generation, AI transcription/alignment, scraping, publishing, hosted transitions, and workflows that need media IDs or remote jobs.
- Use local `ffmpeg` for deterministic transforms on files you already have or can download: trim, crop/scale/pad, concat (merging multiple clips), replace audio, extract audio/frame, reverse, normalize for delivery, burn captions, split scenes, cut silence, and build analysis artifacts. **Always merge clips locally** — server-side merge can hang for 30+ minutes once any input exceeds ~7MB.

When a task starts from a Wonda media ID but the actual edit is deterministic, move it to local files first:

```bash
wonda media download <mediaId> -o ./input.mp4
```

Before any local ffmpeg work:

```bash
which ffmpeg
which ffprobe
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams -of json ./input.mp4
```

Font rule for local caption/text work:

- Prefer an explicit font file path over a family name.
- Never assume a font exists. Check first with `fc-match`, `fc-list`, `/System/Library/Fonts`, `/Library/Fonts`, `~/Library/Fonts`, or `/usr/share/fonts`.
- If the task is mainly local finishing/captions/formatting/splitting/artifact extraction, check the `ffmpeg` skill before inventing commands.
- `wonda edit video` runs a **local ffmpeg** for every editor op: `trim`, `crop`, `volume`, `speed`, `reverseVideo`, `extractFrame`, `extractAudio`, `editAudio`, `imageCrop`, `imageToVideo`, `merge`, `overlay`, `splitScreen`, `splitScenes`, `skipSilence`. The render runs on your machine via ffmpeg: no server-side `editor_job` and no credit hold for the render itself (inputs are downloaded and the result uploaded around it). `textOverlay` and `animatedCaptions` also run locally, via the bundled hyperframes (Chromium) renderer. ffmpeg must be on PATH (`wonda doctor` verifies). The public API `/video/edit`, `/image/edit`, `/audio/edit` are no longer used for these and return 410 Gone.
- **Always merge clips locally.** Server-side merge can hang for 30+ minutes once any input exceeds ~7MB, and `wonda edit video --operation merge` now runs in local ffmpeg by default for the same reason.
- **Never mix per-clip audio then concat.** Concat the video tracks first, then layer the full voiceover or music track once over the joined timeline. Per-clip audio bakes create cut-line collisions and silent gaps.

Default local export target unless the user asked otherwise:

```bash
-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 192k
```

Always pass `-y` as the first flag so the command auto-overwrites the output. `ffmpeg` prompts interactively when the output path exists and agent shells hang on that prompt until timeout.

### Step 2.6: Pick the right local tool

Editing maps to one of four tools. Pick the first row that matches.

| Need                                                         | Tool                                                                   | Why                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primitive transform (trim, crop, speed, merge, overlay, ...) | `wonda edit video --operation <op>`                                    | Wraps local ffmpeg. Free, deterministic, renders on your machine (no server render, no credits). |
| Motion graphics, animated text, lower thirds, intro/outro    | `wonda compose <kind>` (hyperframes HTML compositions, local render)   | One-shot, no Lambda, no Node bundled into wonda. Requires Node >= 22 + ffmpeg.                   |
| Kinetic captions, branded effects pipelines, scene FX        | `wonda transitions run --preset <name>` (miruna's transitions service) | Hosted; richer effect library (SAM3 masking, scene transitions, caption presets).                |
| One-off raw transform not covered by a primitive             | Raw `ffmpeg` via Bash (see the `ffmpeg` skill)                         | Faster than picking a wrong primitive; matches "deterministic transform on local files".         |
| Complex multi-step pipeline                                  | Chain the above (`wonda edit ...` → raw ffmpeg → `wonda compose ...`)  | Each step writes a local mp4; pass it as `--input` / `--media` to the next.                      |

Run `wonda doctor` once on a new machine to confirm ffmpeg, node, and hyperframes are all available. Pass `--warm-chrome` to pre-fetch hyperframes' bundled Chromium (~150 MB) so the first clipping render doesn't pause to download it. Pass `--wab` to also audit the on-disk WAB browser runtime (installed driver vs this build's pin, driver tree manifest); offline, read-only, and advisory like `--relay`.

**Examples:**

Primitive trim and merge (wonda edit, local ffmpeg):

```bash
wonda edit video --operation trim --media $VID \
  --params '{"trimStartMs":3000,"trimEndMs":10000}' \
  --wait -o ./trimmed.mp4

wonda edit video --operation merge --media $A,$B,$C \
  --wait -o ./merged.mp4
```

Motion graphics intro (wonda compose, hyperframes):

```bash
wonda compose motion --template fade-in \
  --text "Q4 Recap" --subtitle "Wondercat" \
  --duration 4 --resolution portrait -o intro.mp4

wonda compose text --input ./clip.mp4 --text "NEW DROP" \
  --position bottom-center -o overlay.mp4
```

Kinetic captions on a finished clip (transitions service):

```bash
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset caption_word_pop --wait -o final.mp4
```

Raw ffmpeg for an op no primitive covers (e.g. concat with audio fade out):

```bash
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt \
  -af "afade=out:st=29:d=1" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -c:a aac -b:a 192k out.mp4
```

Multi-step pipeline (compose intro → wonda merge with main → transitions captions):

```bash
wonda compose motion --template scale-pop --text "Hello" --duration 3 -o intro.mp4
wonda edit video --operation merge --media $(wonda media upload intro.mp4 --quiet),$MAIN_VID \
  --wait -o merged.mp4
MERGED_ID=$(wonda media upload merged.mp4 --quiet)
wonda transitions run --media $MERGED_ID --preset caption_word_pop --wait -o final.mp4
```

### Step 3: Build from scratch (chain endpoints)

When no skill matches, chain individual CLI commands. Each step produces an output that feeds into the next.

**Single asset:**

```bash
wonda generate image --model gpt-image-2 --prompt "..." --aspect-ratio 9:16 --wait -o out.png
# --params '{"quality":"high"}' — auto/low/medium/high (default auto)
# --negative-prompt "..."       — override what to exclude (model-dependent)
# --seed <number>               — pin the seed for reproducible results (model-dependent)
wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "..." --duration 5 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait -o out.mp4
wonda generate text --model <model> --prompt "..." --wait
wonda generate music --model suno-music --prompt "upbeat lo-fi" --wait -o music.mp3
```

**Audio (speech, transcription, dialogue):**

```bash
# List available voices (TTS + dialogue use the same set)
wonda audio voices

# Text-to-speech
wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "Your script here" \
  --params '{"voiceId":"hpp4J3VqNfWAUOO0d1Us"}' --wait -o speech.mp3
# elevenlabs-tts always requires a voiceId — pick one from `wonda audio voices`

# Transcribe audio/video to text
wonda audio transcribe --model elevenlabs-stt --attach $MEDIA --wait

# Multi-speaker dialogue (each speaker needs a voiceId from `wonda audio voices`)
wonda audio dialogue --model elevenlabs-dialogue \
  --prompt 'ALICE: Hi! BOB: Hello!' \
  --params '{"speakers":[{"label":"ALICE","voiceId":"hpp4J3VqNfWAUOO0d1Us"},{"label":"BOB","voiceId":"IKne3meq5aSn9XLyUdCD"}]}' \
  --wait -o dialogue.mp3
```

**Audio AI operations (direct-inference, NOT editor ops):**

```bash
# Denoise / dereverberate speech
wonda audio enhance --model replicate-resemble-enhance --attach $MEDIA \
  --params '{"denoise":true,"chunkSeconds":10}' --wait -o enhanced.wav

# Split a track into voice and instrumental stems
wonda audio extract-voice --model replicate-demucs --attach $MEDIA \
  --wait -o vocals.wav
```

**Add animated captions to a video:**

The `animatedCaptions` operation handles everything in one step — it extracts audio, transcribes for word-level timing, and renders animated word-by-word captions onto the video.

```bash
# Generate a video with speech audio
VID_JOB=$(wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "..." --duration 5 --aspect-ratio 9:16 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait --quiet)
VID_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $VID_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')

# Add animated captions (single step)
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' \
  --wait -o final.mp4
```

The video's original audio is preserved. Do NOT replace the audio with TTS — Sora already generated the speech.

**Transitions (effects pipelines on a single video):**

```bash
wonda transitions presets                            # List built-in presets (JSON)
wonda transitions operations                         # Grouped by category (analysis/effect/...)
wonda transitions operations --json                  # Full per-param metadata
wonda transitions llms                               # Full reference (presets + ops + dependencies)
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset flash_glow --wait -o out.mp4
# Or send an agent-generated timeline of clips (inline JSON):
wonda transitions run --media $VID \
  --clips '[{"layer_type":"video","start_frame":0,"end_frame":60}]' --wait -o out.mp4
# Or from a file (handy for long agent timelines):
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json --wait -o out.mp4
# To attach scene_transitions: pass an envelope (clips + scene_transitions)
# instead of a bare clip array — same file, both fields forwarded.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline_with_transitions.json --wait -o out.mp4
# where timeline_with_transitions.json is:
#   { "clips": [...],
#     "scene_transitions": [{"name":"crossfade","params":{"duration":8},"boundaries":[60]}] }
wonda transitions job <jobId>                        # Poll a transition job
```

Use exactly one of `--preset` or `--clips`. Requires a full (logged-in) account. **Always read `wonda transitions llms` first when composing a clips timeline.** It documents the detect/segment/effect dependencies, which ops need masks, and the full clip-spec shape (layer types, tracks, effects, transforms).

**Preset variables (`variables` block).** Each preset declares the template variables it accepts under `variables` in `wonda transitions presets`. Each entry has `name`, `description`, and `required`. Required variables MUST be supplied or the job is rejected with a 400 — no more silent skipping. Pass them with `--var name=value` (repeatable) or, for the common `prompt` case, the `--prompt` shortcut:

```bash
# flash_glow_prompted requires { prompt }
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset flash_glow_prompted \
  --prompt "woman in white dress" --wait -o out.mp4

# text_behind_person requires { prompt, text }
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset text_behind_person \
  --var prompt="the person" --var text="HELLO WORLD" --wait -o out.mp4

# Numeric-typed vars: bare digits are decoded as numbers, "true"/"false" as
# bools, everything else stays a string. Presets that compare frame indices
# numerically (border_frame, marquee_text, quick_motion_text, bg_remove_scale)
# need this — quoting an int turns it back into a string.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset border_frame \
  --var exit_start_frame=200 --var exit_end_frame=251 --wait -o out.mp4
```

The `prompt` variable is a **detection text query** describing which subject to mask, fed to SAM3 to produce per-frame segmentation masks. Not a content-generation prompt.

Building a custom `--clips` timeline that needs detection masks? Add a clip with `layer_type: "video"` and a `mask: {layer_type: "mask", analysis_steps: [{name: segment, params: {prompt: "..."}}]}`. SAM3 handles both detection and segmentation in one step from the prompt, so no separate `detect` step is needed.

### Pre-warming masks before render (recommended)

For presets with `mask:<label>` variables, run `wonda transitions ensure-masks` first so the render starts with masks already prepared. The first call for a (media, label) pair takes 1-3 minutes; subsequent calls are near-instant.

```bash
# 1. Ensure masks are prepared for the labels you'll use, blocking until ready.
wonda transitions ensure-masks --media $VID --labels person,phone --wait

# 2. Run the render. Masks are already prepared.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset slide_reflect_background \
  --var "masks=mask:person+phone" --wait -o out.mp4
```

`ensure-masks` flags:

- `--media MEDIA_ID` — required, the video the masks are for
- `--label NAME` — repeatable, one label per call (`--label person --label phone`)
- `--labels NAME,NAME` — comma-separated alternative (`--labels person,phone`)
- `--wait` — block until every label is prepared
- `--timeout DUR` — cap wait time when `--wait` is set (default 10m)

Multi-prompt syntax: `mask:woman+phone` in `--var` is split into separate masks (`woman`, `phone`) and unioned per-frame. Pass each sub-label separately to `ensure-masks` so all of them are pre-warmed.

When to skip `ensure-masks`:

- Non-mask presets (no `mask:<label>` variables) — nothing to prepare
- A previous render already used these (media, labels) — already prepared

When `ensure-masks` matters most:

- First render of a new media with mask-based presets
- Iterating params on a render — pre-warm once, then run as many times as you want without re-preparing

**Multi-scene presets (`requiresMultiScene: true`).** Some presets use scene-aware logic and expect a video with multiple cuts/scenes. Check `requiresMultiScene` in `wonda transitions presets`. If true, feeding a single continuous shot will produce only one scene and the effect may look underwhelming. Combine clips first or use a video with natural cuts.

**Tweaking preset params.** Every preset is clip-shape. Pull a single preset with `wonda transitions preset <name> --json`, read its `clips:` (single-track) or `tracks:` (multi-track) field, edit any clip param, and submit as `--clips`. For multi-track presets, flatten by giving each clip a `track` index drawn from the track it came from. If the preset declares `sceneTransitions:`, pass that array through unchanged on the request.

```bash
# Single-track preset (e.g. flash_glow_montage): copy clips: directly
wonda transitions preset flash_glow_montage --json | jq '.preset.clips' > clips.json
# edit clips.json
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips "$(cat clips.json)" --wait -o out.mp4
```

**Auto-repair safety net (`--auto-repair`, `--face-bbox`).** For `--clips` renders the worker runs a deterministic repair pass on the submitted JSON before rendering, default on. Repairs: width-fit font clamp, descender clamp against canvas bottom, stack-spacing snap (`ROW1_py` from cap-height formula), keyframe-bound clamp to `[0, source_duration]`, same-y-row caption overlap trim, mask full-duration extension, stroke-width zeroing, letter-spacing target snap per font, mask-cutout duration extension, negative-start clamp, and (with `--face-bbox`) face-overlap caption shift. Pass `--auto-repair=false` for strict validation; out-of-spec values then surface as render errors.

```bash
# Push body captions off the speaker's face. bbox is x1,y1,x2,y2 in canvas pixels (top-left origin).
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json \
  --face-bbox 200,160,520,520 --wait -o out.mp4

# Strict mode — disable auto-repair to see exactly which clips fail validation.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json \
  --auto-repair=false --wait -o out.mp4
```

`--face-bbox` only shifts body captions. Decorative text you want behind the speaker still routes through an explicit `mask_cutout {prompt: "person"}` clip.

**Output URL paths differ by job type:**

- Inference jobs (generate, audio): `.outputs[0].media.url` and `.outputs[0].media.mediaId`
- Editor jobs (edit): `.outputs[0].url` and `.outputs[0].mediaId`

## Model waterfall

### Image

Default: `gpt-image-2`. OpenAI's flagship — strongest prompt adherence, best text-in-image, high-fidelity edits via reference images. Handles 1-4 reference images. Quality tiers: `auto` (default), `low`, `medium`, `high` — pass via `--params '{"quality":"high"}'`. Caps at 1536px output.

For img2img editing specifically (change, add/remove, restyle, bg-remove, crop, text overlay, vectorize), use `wonda skill get image-edit` — it has the full edit-specific decision tree.

Pick something else only when one of these applies:

- User explicitly requests another model
- **More than 4 reference images** → `nano-banana-2` (gpt-image-2 caps at 4 refs; nano-banana-2 accepts up to 14). For 1-4 refs, stay on `gpt-image-2`.
- Need vector output → `runware-vectorize`
- Need background removal → `birefnet-bg-removal`
- Cheapest possible / fastest drafts → `z-image`
- Need >1536px / true 4K output → `nano-banana-pro` (1K/2K/4K) or `nano-banana-2` (1K/2K/4K). gpt-image-2 caps at 1536px.
- gpt-image-2 unavailable / OpenAI down → `nano-banana-2` or `seedream-4-5` or `grok-imagine-pro`

### Video

Default: `seedance-2` (duration 5/10/15s, default 5s, quality: high). Escalation:

- Quality complaint or different style → `sora2` or `sora2pro`
- Max single-clip duration is **15s** for Seedance 2, **20s** for Sora → for longer content, stitch multiple clips via merge
- Veo (`veo3_1`, `veo3_1-fast`) is available but NOT in the default waterfall. Only pick Veo when the user explicitly asks for Veo by name.
- Gemini Omni (`gemini-omni-video`) is available but NOT in the default waterfall. Only pick it when the user asks for Gemini by name, or specifically needs multi-image reference T2V/I2V (up to 7 reference images) or 4K output.

**Image-to-video routing (MANDATORY when attaching a reference image):**

- Person/face visible in the **reference image** → MUST use `kling_3_pro` (preserves identity better for faces)
- No person in reference image → use `seedance-2`
- **Text-to-video (no reference image):** Seedance 2 generates people fine. This rule ONLY applies when you `--attach` an image.

**Kling model family:**

- `kling_3_pro` — Text-to-video and image-to-video, supports start/end images, custom elements (@Element1, @Element2), 3-15s duration, 16:9/9:16/1:1
- `kling_2_6_pro` — General purpose, 5-10s, 16:9/9:16/1:1, text-to-video and image-to-video
- `kling_2_6_motion_control` — Motion transfer: requires both a reference image AND a reference video, recreates the video's motion with the image's appearance
- `kling2_5-pro` — Budget Kling option, 5-10s, supports first/last frame images

**Kling prompt rules (important):** Kling's prompt field caps at **2,500 characters** and Kling responds poorly to Sora-style structured briefs (`SCENE:` / `SUBJECT:` / `MOTION:` / `BANNED LOOK:` section headers). In that format Kling latches onto atmosphere nouns and silently drops the central subject (verified empirically: the same 2,842-char Sora-style prompt that rendered correctly on Sora 2 Pro and Seedance 2 produced no phone at all on Kling — even when trimmed to 2,250 chars). When escalating Seedance → Kling, or targeting Kling directly, **rewrite the prompt as short natural-language prose (~1,000–1,500 chars)** and **lead with the hero subject in the opening sentence** rather than burying it inside a `SUBJECT:` block. Do NOT pass a Sora-formatted prompt through to Kling unchanged.

**Other video models:**

- `grok-imagine-video` — xAI video generation, 5-15s, supports 7 aspect ratios including 4:3 and 3:2
- `gemini-omni-video`: Google Gemini Omni. Text-to-video and image-to-video with up to 7 reference images (slots `reference_image_1` through `reference_image_7`). Durations 4/6/8/10s, aspect ratios 9:16 and 16:9, resolutions 720p / 1080p / 4K. Pricing: $0.15 base + $0.075/s at 720p/1080p, $0.75 base + $0.075/s at 4K. No native audio (pair with a separate audio model if speech is needed).
- `topaz-video-upscale` — Upscale video resolution (1-4x factor, supports fps conversion)
- `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` — Legacy lipsync for user-supplied video + audio pairs. Inferior to native-audio generation and almost never the right choice for new content. See the "Lip sync" section for rules.

Seedance family (DEFAULT video model, watermarks automatically removed):

- `seedance-2` — Base Seedance 2.0 (T2V/I2V, 5-15s, high=standard/basic=fast)
- `seedance-2-omni` — Multi-reference generation (images, audio refs)
- `seedance-2-video-edit` — Edit existing video via text prompt

**Video durations:** Accepted `--duration` values vary by model. Check with `wonda capabilities` or `wonda models info <slug>`.

### Audio

- Music: `suno-music` (set `--params '{"instrumental":true}'` for no vocals)
- Text-to-speech: `elevenlabs-tts` — only for explicit narrator/voice-over asks over silent footage. Do NOT use to "make a UGC character talk" — Sora / Sora 2 Pro / Veo 3.1 / Kling 3 / Seedance 2 generate native synced speech in any language, which looks and sounds far better. Always set voiceId in params. Default female voice: `--params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}'` (Rachel).
- Transcription: `elevenlabs-stt`
- Multi-speaker dialogue: `elevenlabs-dialogue`
- Enhance audio (clean up noisy speech): `replicate-resemble-enhance` via `wonda audio enhance` — denoise + dereverberate. Use when a voice recording sounds muffled, echoey, or has background noise. NOT a general "sounds better" button; if the source is already clean this can soften it.
- Extract voice (isolate vocals / split stems): `replicate-demucs` via `wonda audio extract-voice` — splits into voice and instrumental tracks. Use to pull a speaker or singer off a track, or to isolate the music behind a vocal.

**Native synced speech (preferred over TTS + lipsync):** Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate dialogue in any language directly inside the video, with mouth movements baked in. Put the line (and language) in the video model's `--prompt`. Never chain `elevenlabs-tts` → `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` to fake speech over a silent generation.

## Characters

Characters are reusable saved combos (image + optional voice audio) you can mention in prompts with `@name`. The server auto-injects the image, optional face video, and audio into the right slots for the selected model. Works on Kling 3 Pro (`start_image` + `element_1` + `voice_audio`) and Seedance 2 Omni (`ref_image_1` + `ref_video_1` + `ref_audio_1`). Name rules: must start with a letter, 1–31 chars, alphanumeric + `_`/`-`.

**Provider gotchas (Seedance 2 Omni):** when a character is mentioned, the API routes Seedance to MuAPI automatically. Replicate enforces a 15s `ref_audio_1` cap and rejects famous-celebrity refs with `E005 — input flagged as sensitive`. MuAPI is the reliable path for character-driven jobs. Even on MuAPI, top-tier celebrity refs (think Sydney Sweeney, Leonardo DiCaprio) are blocked with `"Face detected in uploaded image. Please use an image without real people."` Non-celebrity faces and lesser-known public figures pass cleanly. If you see that error on a real-person ref, use Kling 3 Pro instead (its character pipeline runs voice cloning server-side, so the raw face audio never touches a moderation classifier).

**From a Kling clip** — extract a frame + voice from a generation you like:

```bash
VID=$(wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "young man, grey tshirt, talking to camera" --wait --quiet)
VID_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $VID --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda character from-media alex --source $VID_MEDIA --frame-ms 2500
wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "@alex welcomes viewers to the channel" --wait -o alex-welcome.mp4
```

**From scratch** — generate a portrait and a TTS sample, then bind them:

```bash
IMG=$(wonda generate image --model nano-banana-2 --prompt "young woman, studio portrait" --wait --quiet)
IMG_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $IMG --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
AUD=$(wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "Hi, this is me" --params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}' --wait --quiet)
AUD_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $AUD --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda character create maya --image $IMG_MEDIA --audio $AUD_MEDIA
```

List / inspect / update / delete: `wonda character list`, `wonda character get <name>`, `wonda character update <name> --audio $NEW`, `wonda character delete <name>`. Only one character with audio can be referenced per generation.

## Prompt writing rules

Follow this waterfall top-to-bottom. Use the FIRST matching rule and stop.

1. **PASSTHROUGH** — If the user says "use my exact prompt" / "verbatim" / "no enhancements" → copy their words exactly. Zero modifications.

2. **IMAGE-TO-VIDEO** — When a source image feeds into a video model, describe MOTION ONLY. The model can see the image. Do NOT describe the image content.
   - Good: `"gentle breathing motion, camera slowly pushes in, atmospheric lighting shifts"`
   - Bad: `"Two cats on a lavender background breathing softly"` (describes the image)

3. **EMPTY PROMPT (from scratch)** — Use the user's exact request as the prompt. Do NOT add style descriptors, lighting, composition, or mood.
   - User says "create an image of a cat with sunglasses" → prompt: `"create an image of a cat with sunglasses"`
   - Do NOT enhance to `"A playful orange tabby wearing oversized reflective sunglasses, studio lighting, shallow depth of field"`

4. **NON-EMPTY PROMPT (adapting a template)** — Keep the structure and style, only swap content to match the user's request. Keep prompts literal and constraint-heavy.

## Aspect ratio rules

Three cases, no exceptions:

1. User specifies a ratio → use it: `--aspect-ratio 16:9`
2. User doesn't mention ratio → explicitly set `--aspect-ratio 9:16` for social content (UGC, TikTok, Reels, Stories). Portrait is the default for any social/marketing video.
3. Editing existing media → use `--aspect-ratio auto` to preserve source dimensions

**UGC and social content is ALWAYS portrait (9:16).** If someone asks for a TikTok, Reel, Story, or UGC video, always use `--aspect-ratio 9:16`. Landscape is only for YouTube, presentations, or when explicitly requested.

**Square (1:1)** is supported by all Kling models and some image models — use for Instagram feed posts when requested.

## Common chaining patterns

These patterns show how to compose multi-step pipelines by chaining CLI commands. Each step's output feeds into the next.

> **No need to download and re-upload between steps.** Every generation and edit
> produces a media ID in its output. Pass that ID directly to the next command
> via `--media` or `--audio-media`. Use `--jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId'`
> for inference jobs and `--jq '.outputs[0].mediaId'` for editor jobs.
> Only use `-o <file>` on the FINAL step to download the finished output.

### Animate an image to video

```bash
MEDIA=$(wonda media upload ./product.jpg --quiet)
# No person in image → Seedance 2
wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "camera slowly pushes in, product rotates" \
  --attach $MEDIA --duration 5 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait -o animated.mp4
# Person in image → Kling (ONLY when attaching a reference image with a person)
wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "the person turns and smiles" \
  --attach $MEDIA --duration 5 --wait -o person.mp4
```

### Replace audio on a video (TTS voiceover or music)

```bash
# Generate TTS
TTS_JOB=$(wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "The script" \
  --params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}' --wait --quiet)
TTS_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $TTS_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
# Mix onto video (mute original, full voiceover)
wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID_MEDIA --audio-media $TTS_MEDIA \
  --params '{"videoVolume":0,"audioVolume":100}' --wait -o with-voice.mp4
```

Only use this when you need to REPLACE the video's audio. Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate native synced speech in any language — don't replace it with TTS unless the user explicitly asks for a different voiceover. Never reach for this step to "add speech" to a UGC/talking-head clip; put the dialogue in the video model's prompt instead.

### Add static text overlay

Static overlays (meme text, "chat did i cook", etc.) use smaller font sizes than captions. They're ambient, not meant to dominate the frame.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "chat, did i cook" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"top-center","sizePercent":66,"fontSizeScale":0.5,"strokeWidth":4.5,"paddingTop":10}' \
  --wait -o with-text.mp4
```

**Featured textOverlay + animatedCaptions presets.** `wonda edit {video,image,audio}` accepts `--preset <name>` (scoped to `--operation`). `--params` fields override preset values on key collisions.

`textOverlay` (static, top-centered):

- `TikTok White Highlight` — black text on a slightly rounded white box.
- `TikTok Black Highlight` — white text on a slightly rounded black box.
- `TikTok Red Highlight` — white text on a slightly rounded red (`#E14135`) box.

`animatedCaptions` (STT-driven, bottom-centered):

- `TikTok White Captions` — black text, white highlight on the active word.
- `TikTok Black Captions` — white text, black highlight on the active word.
- `TikTok Red Captions` — white text, red (`#E14135`) highlight on the active word.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay \
  --preset "TikTok Red Highlight" --media <id> \
  --params '{"text":"YOUR HEADLINE"}' --wait -o ./out.mp4
```

`textOverlay` renders locally via the bundled hyperframes (Chromium) renderer. There is no server-side image `textOverlay` anymore.

**Font sizing guide:**

- Static overlays: `sizePercent: 66`, `fontSizeScale: 0.5`, `strokeWidth: 4.5`
- Animated captions: `sizePercent: 80`, `fontSizeScale: 0.8`, `strokeWidth: 2.5`, `highlightColor: rgb(252, 61, 61)`
- Font: `TikTok Sans SemiCondensed` for both

### Add animated captions (word-by-word with timing)

The `animatedCaptions` operation extracts audio, transcribes, and renders animated word-by-word captions — all in one step.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' \
  --wait -o with-captions.mp4
```

For quick static captions (no timing, just text on screen), use `textOverlay` with `--prompt-text`:

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "Summer Sale - 50% Off" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80}' \
  --wait -o captioned.mp4
```

### Add background music

```bash
MUSIC_JOB=$(wonda generate music --model suno-music \
  --prompt "upbeat lo-fi hip hop, warm vinyl crackle" --wait --quiet)
MUSIC_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $MUSIC_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID_MEDIA --audio-media $MUSIC_MEDIA \
  --params '{"videoVolume":100,"audioVolume":30}' --wait -o with-music.mp4
```

### Editor output chaining

When chaining multiple editor operations (e.g., editAudio → animatedCaptions → textOverlay), extract the media ID from each editor job output and pass it to the next step. Note the jq path differs from inference jobs:

```bash
# Inference jobs: .outputs[0].media.mediaId
# Editor jobs:    .outputs[0].mediaId

EDIT_JOB=$(wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID --audio-media $AUDIO \
  --params '{"videoVolume":0,"audioVolume":100}' --wait --quiet)
STEP1_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get editor $EDIT_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].mediaId')

CAP_JOB=$(wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $STEP1_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' --wait --quiet)
STEP2_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get editor $CAP_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].mediaId')

wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $STEP2_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "Hook text" --params '{"position":"top-center","fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","sizePercent":66,"fontSizeScale":0.5,"strokeWidth":4.5}' --wait -o final.mp4
```

### Merge multiple clips

**Always merge locally with ffmpeg.** Server-side merge (`wonda edit video --operation merge`) can hang for 30+ minutes once any input exceeds ~7MB.

Download every Wonda media ID, then concat. Stream-copy is fast but requires matching codec/profile/resolution; fall back to re-encode if it errors:

```bash
wonda media download $CLIP1 -o /tmp/clip-1.mp4
wonda media download $CLIP2 -o /tmp/clip-2.mp4
wonda media download $CLIP3 -o /tmp/clip-3.mp4
cat > /tmp/concat.txt <<EOF
file '/tmp/clip-1.mp4'
file '/tmp/clip-2.mp4'
file '/tmp/clip-3.mp4'
EOF
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i /tmp/concat.txt -c copy /tmp/merged.mp4
# If stream-copy fails, re-encode:
# ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i /tmp/concat.txt \
#   -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
#   -c:a aac -b:a 192k /tmp/merged.mp4

# Re-upload only if a downstream wonda step needs the mediaId.
MERGED_MEDIA=$(wonda media upload /tmp/merged.mp4 --quiet)
```

File order in `concat.txt` = playback order. See the `ffmpeg` skill for the full concat reference.

### Split scenes / keep a specific scene

Two modes, pick by intent:

```bash
# Split mode (default) — returns EVERY detected scene as its own media.
# JSON output lists each scene under scenes[] ({mediaId,index,startS,endS}).
wonda edit video --operation splitScenes --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"mode":"split","threshold":0.5,"minClipDuration":2}' --json
# With -o, each scene downloads to a numbered file (out-1.mp4, out-2.mp4, ...);
# a single detected scene writes the path verbatim.
wonda edit video --operation splitScenes --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"mode":"split","threshold":0.5,"minClipDuration":2}' -o scenes.mp4

# Remove a scene (omit mode) — removes one scene, merges the rest into one file.
wonda edit video --operation splitScenes --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"mode":"omit","threshold":0.5,"minClipDuration":2,"outputSelection":"first"}' \
  --wait -o without-first.mp4
# outputSelection (omit mode only): "first", "last", or a 1-indexed number = which scene to REMOVE
```

Use omit mode for "remove frozen first frame" (common with Sora videos). Use split mode to get all scenes as separate clips.

### Image editing

Any image edit — img2img, background removal, crop, text overlay, vectorize — has its own skill with the full decision tree, aspect-ratio rules, and model waterfall for edits:

```bash
wonda skill get image-edit
```

One gotcha worth keeping here: image and video background removal use **different** models (`birefnet-bg-removal` vs `bria-video-background-removal`). Never swap them.

### Lip sync (last-resort fallback — prefer native-audio video models)

Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate speech in any language with correctly synced mouth movements as part of the video itself. That path produces dramatically better results than `sync-lipsync-v2-pro`: better lip physics, better lighting, better costs, and no second inference round-trip. For any talking UGC, ad, or spokesperson video, put the dialogue directly in the video model's prompt — do not chain TTS + lipsync.

Only reach for `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` when the user EXPLICITLY supplies both a pre-existing video and a pre-existing audio clip and asks you to align the mouth to that audio. If a user asks for lipsync as the default method of making a character speak, push back: the native-audio video models are the better tool and work in any language.

```bash
wonda generate video --model sync-lipsync-v2-pro --attach $VIDEO_MEDIA,$AUDIO_MEDIA --wait -o synced.mp4
```

### Video upscale

```bash
wonda generate video --model topaz-video-upscale --attach $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --params '{"upscaleFactor":2}' --wait -o upscaled.mp4
```

### Clipping (longform → vertical shorts)

`wonda clipping` takes a long video (podcast, interview, talking-head)
and produces short vertical clips. Selection is LLM-driven and supports
a natural-language `--brief` so you can ask for specific moments instead
of generic virality.

V1 renders 9:16 with **face-tracked reframe** (LR-ASD active-speaker
detection + One-Euro stabilizer, default) and the existing
`animatedCaptions` op + a top-third hook overlay per clip. Pass
`--reframe blur-fill` to keep the full landscape source inside a
vertical canvas with a blurred background instead.

**Translated captions:** pass `--caption-language <code>` (ISO-639-1,
e.g. `en`) to render captions in another language while keeping the
original audio. Each clip's transcript is translated per sentence and the
spoken timing is preserved, so captions stay in sync. Omit the flag to
caption in the spoken language. On `--restyle`, the language is inherited
from the parent job unless overridden, so you can cheaply spin out an
English-captioned version of an already-clipped job (reuses the
transcript, no re-transcription).

Async: `POST /api/v1/clipping` returns a `clippingJobId`; the CLI polls
`GET /api/v1/clipping/jobs/{id}` under `--wait`. Pass `--output <dir>`
and the CLI downloads each rendered clip + a `plan.json`.

Auth: included in the paid plan.

**Source: `--url` accepts YouTube and direct mp4 URLs.**

```bash
wonda clipping --url "<youtube-url>" --brief "the most controversial moments" --wait
```

YouTube links work; a long video can take several minutes to ingest before
transcription starts. If a YouTube ingest fails, download the file locally
and upload it first, then clip with `--media`:

```bash
yt-dlp -o /tmp/source.mp4 \
  -f "bv*[ext=mp4][height<=720]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4][height<=720]" \
  --merge-output-format mp4 "<youtube-url>"
MEDIA=$(wonda media upload /tmp/source.mp4 --no-transcode --quiet)
```

`--no-transcode` skips the server-side normalize so longform sources are
usable in seconds instead of minutes (a 1 h upload otherwise transcodes for
~19 min before clipping can start). Clipping handles incompatible formats
(AV1, rotated phone video) per selected clip automatically. Omit the flag
for uploads you plan to publish or edit directly without clipping.

```bash
# Plan only — fast, no render
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "the most controversial moments" --dry-run --wait

# Full pipeline: select + render + download
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA \
  --brief "the most controversial moments" \
  --caption-preset "TikTok Red Captions" \
  --hook auto \
  --wait --output ./clips/

# Translate captions to English (original audio kept)
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --caption-language en --wait --output ./clips/

# Re-caption an existing job into English (reuses STT + clip picks, ~$0)
wonda clipping --restyle <jobId> --caption-language en --wait --output ./clips/

# Filter by speaker (uses ElevenLabs diarization labels)
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --speaker SPEAKER_00 --wait --output ./clips/

# Speaker rename for readable rationales
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --speaker Joe \
  --speaker-map '{"SPEAKER_00":"Joe","SPEAKER_01":"Guest"}' --wait --output ./clips/

# Tune count and durations — pick a target length with a tolerance
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "punchy one-liners" \
  --count 5 --duration 20 --tolerance 5 --wait --output ./clips/

# Or specify an explicit min/max range instead (mutually exclusive
# with --duration/--tolerance)
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "punchy one-liners" \
  --count 5 --min-duration 8 --max-duration 30 --wait --output ./clips/

# Auto-pick FX preset per clip from a catalog
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --auto-preset \
  --preset-catalog '[{"slug":"flash_glow","description":"glow + scene flash"},{"slug":"text_glow","description":"per-word text glow"}]' \
  --wait --output ./clips/

> **`crop` vs `imageCrop`:** video `crop` is **ratio/percent** based (`aspectRatio` or `cropPercent`+`cropAxis`); it does NOT take pixel coordinates and rejects `cropPixelX/Y/Width/Height` with an error. For an **exact pixel rectangle**, use `imageCrop`. Run `wonda operations info <operation>` for the full param list, defaults, and ranges of any op.

### X/Twitter

Supports reads, writes, and social graph.

> ⚠️ **Anti-fraud caution: don't probe freshly-pasted cookies.** When you've just received cookies (yours or a user's), the FIRST request on them should be the operation the user actually wants, not `wonda x auth check`, not `wonda x home`, not anything that fires a probe. Burst activity on a new IP / device / process is the textbook signal X (and Reddit / LinkedIn / IG) flag as credential theft, and the cookies get shadow-banned or hard-killed. If you must verify, use `wonda x auth check --account <name> --via wab` (that routes through the account's existing logged-in browser session: same IP, same fingerprint, same browsing history) instead of firing a raw API request from a fresh process.

```bash

All paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--cursor`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

`wonda x user` includes additive `emails` and `links` fields when the member has published explicit contact details in their public bio or X exposes expanded URL entities for that profile. These fields are read-only and equivalent to manually reading the profile. No inferred emails, enrichment data, storage, or DOM scraping is involved.

**Tweet modes:** The `tweet` command has two transports:

- **`--via cookies` (internal API):** X's internal GraphQL (`CreateTweet` for ≤280 chars, `CreateNoteTweet` for long-form Premium). Fast (<1s), supports `--attach` for media. Occasionally fails with error 226 when X rotates query IDs or feature flags. When that happens, recapture via `twitter-tone-research/_artifacts/scripts/capture-ct-bw.mjs` and bump the three knobs in `xclient/`.
- **`--via wab` (default for writes):** Routes through the account's WAB Chromium (auto-spawned on first `--via wab` use), opens x.com compose, types with human-style jitter, clicks Post. Supports `--attach` (image/gif/video, up to 4); files are driven through the hidden compose input via Playwright's `setInputFiles`, no native picker dialog opens; the script waits for X's upload pipeline to finalize (up to 5 min for video) before submitting. Zero fingerprinting risk. Slower (~10s text, ~30-90s with video) but fully drift-proof: no queryIds, feature flags, or request shape to maintain. The stealth browser + Chromium install once via `wonda wab install` (~315 MB, one-time, idempotent). Cookies live in `~/.wonda/x-cookies/<account>.json`, bound to the account's persona via `account-bindings.json`. `wonda x reply --attach` is wab-only (no cookie path).

### Inbound engagement

Received engagement means inbound activity on the twin's own content: replies, mentions, comments, and DMs. This is the reverse direction of outbound posting, liking, and following.

It is not keyword monitor, not sent-invite/outreach acceptance tracking, and not the outbound action ledger. Use platform search commands for keyword monitoring. Use `wonda actions` for outbound action accounting.

```bash
wonda inbound                                      # New inbound items for every local persona
wonda inbound --persona brubakerwise              # One persona
wonda inbound --platform x -n 20                  # Only X mentions/replies
wonda inbound --platform linkedin                 # LinkedIn notifications
wonda inbound --platform reddit                   # Reddit classic inbox
wonda inbound --all                               # Dump fetched items without high-water diff or state write
```

`wonda inbound` fans out direct read clients only: X mentions/replies, LinkedIn notifications, and Reddit classic inbox. Output is always normalized JSON:

```json

By default it persists a high-water mark per persona/platform/account at `~/.wonda/wab/personas/<persona>/inbound-state.json` and only emits items newer than the last run. Corrupt or missing state is treated as a first run. `--all` bypasses state reads and writes and returns the full fetched set.

**X DMs:** `wonda x dm inbox`, `wonda x dm requests`, and `wonda x dm read` read through the cookie-backed `xclient` path by default and can use `--via wab` for browser-session transport parity. `requests` returns the untrusted/message-request inbox so recipient-side acceptance can be handled explicitly. `wonda x dm send`, `wonda x dm start`, and `wonda x dm accept` are WAB-only DOM writes: sends open the real X messages UI, type into `[data-testid="dmComposerTextInput"]`, and click the composer send button; accept opens the request thread through Chat and clicks the visible Accept/Allow control. `start` verifies that the selected suggestion's screen name equals the requested handle before sending, and WAB DM writes verify the active X browser account when `--account` or persona bindings provide one. If `x dm send` or `x dm start` fails with `recipient_cannot_receive_dm`, X refused the DM before send. Check that the recipient can receive DMs from the sender: mutual follow/connect may be required, and the recipient may need to accept any pending message request before retrying. If X shows an encrypted XChat passcode gate, store the passcode with `wonda x dm passcode set --account <name>`; it is encrypted locally using the same local-secret pattern as cookie-adjacent storage and is never printed or included in failure bundles. Deeper XChat/Juicebox message decrypt/encrypt support remains unsupported until X exposes a thread that needs it.

### LinkedIn

Supports search, profiles, companies, messaging, and engagement.

> ⚠️ **Same anti-fraud caution as X: don't probe freshly-pasted cookies.** First request on new cookies = the actual operation, never a check. LinkedIn's anti-fraud is the most aggressive of all the platforms (force-logout, password reset, account flag). If you must verify, use `wonda linkedin auth check --account <name> --via wab` to route through the account's existing WAB session.

```bash
# Auth setup (run `wonda linkedin auth --help` for details)

wonda linkedin salesnav search "VP marketing" --seniority CXO --region "Berlin, Germany"  # Faceted lead search; also --industry/--company/--function/--connection-of; '~' prefix excludes a value; --csv exports. Facet flags take a plain name OR a facet id: names auto-resolve (companies + connection-of via the global typeahead; titles/regions/industries/functions/schools via the facet typeahead, where CURRENT_TITLE/PAST_TITLE are served under type TITLE and REGION under BING_GEO; SENIORITY_LEVEL and YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE resolve offline against recorded tables first: seniority 100 In Training, 110 Entry Level, 120 Senior, 130 Strategic, 200 Entry Level Manager, 210 Experienced Manager, 220 Director, 300 Vice President, 310 CXO, 320 Owner / Partner; names the tables miss fall back to the typeahead under types SENIORITY_V2 / TENURE, so LinkedIn's own labels like "3 to 5 years" also work). An ambiguous name fails listing the candidate ids with their subtext (industry/location for companies, position/company for people) so you pick and re-run with the id. Each lead already carries the card decoration the search response inlines for free (no per-lead read): connection degree, current-role tenure + start month/year, and spotlight badges (Recently hired, N recent posts). Education/graduation year is NOT in search; add it with `salesnav profile <urn> --enrich`. Default transport is the sales-api JSON path over cookies; pass `--via wab` for the DOM-scrape fallback (drives the logged-in SN SPA and scrapes the rendered result cards) which survives LinkedIn rotating the search decoration id, at the cost of the inlined fields the rendered card does not show (member urn, exact position start dates, the saved/viewed/premium flags, and list-membership counts). Connection degree, current-role tenure, and spotlight badges are still scraped. Same `SalesLead` output and `--csv` columns either way (the CSV flattens the primary JSON lead fields: identity, current role + most recent past role, tenure, spotlight labels, saved/viewed/openLink flags, list count, both URNs; deep nests like the full position list and company URNs stay JSON-only). A sales-api 403 self-heals: the CLI drives the persona WAB to linkedin.com/sales once to mint the SN li_a cookie, syncs cookies, and retries; an error means either recovery cannot help (dead LinkedIn login, no SN seat) or the recovery step itself failed (e.g. the WAB could not start or sync), and the message says which. Recovery is deliberately disabled under explicit credential overrides (--li-at/--jsessionid or the LI_AT/LI_JSESSIONID env), since it reloads the on-disk account store and could switch identity: those invocations surface the manual runbook instead.

Companies do NOT resolve here (the facet typeahead returns [] for CURRENT_COMPANY/PAST_COMPANY): resolve company names via `salesnav typeahead`, or just pass the name to the search flag and let it auto-resolve. The command auto-aliases CURRENT_TITLE/PAST_TITLE to TITLE, REGION to BING_GEO, SENIORITY_LEVEL to SENIORITY_V2, and YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE to TENURE (the types the typeahead actually serves), so `facets SENIORITY_LEVEL` lists the live seniority values

Idempotent: an already-saved lead reports changed:false without clicking. --unsave selects the lead's checkbox on the saved-leads search and clicks the results toolbar's direct Unsave control (primary path, then VERIFIES the result); the old card-overflow menu flow is only a fallback — LinkedIn ignores that menu action (verified 2026-07-22), so a fallback run still ends in an honest sn_unsave_inert error. Also accepts the bare-token urn or a raw lead id, like `salesnav profile`

In --send mode the note field is re-read right before Send and must equal --note or the send aborts (connect_note_mismatch). --expect-name is MANDATORY: the action verifies the rendered lead name before touching the invite and refuses on mismatch (recipient_mismatch).

Paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--start`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

`wonda linkedin profile` includes additive `emails`, `websites`, `phone`, and `twitter` fields when the member exposes them in LinkedIn's Contact info. The contact-info read uses the same logged-in Voyager cookie and CSRF path as profile reads, is best-effort when hidden or rate-limited, and is equivalent to manually opening the Contact info overlay. It does not infer, enrich, persist, or batch-harvest contacts.

**LinkedIn member identity resolution:** `wonda linkedin resolve <id>...` accepts bare `ACoAA...` fsd profile ids plus `urn:li:fsd_profile:` and `urn:li:fs_miniProfile:` wrappers. It performs one cookie-only Voyager read per unique cache miss and stores positive results for 30 days under the selected account. `--no-cache` skips persistent cache reads and writes but still deduplicates within the invocation. Numeric `urn:li:member:<id>` values are rejected because LinkedIn's authenticated web redirect preserves the numeric id and no stable Voyager mapping endpoint is available. `conversations --resolve` and `messages --resolve` use the same cache and only fill existing blank `vanityName` fields; without `--resolve`, their output is unchanged.

`wonda linkedin profile` also returns `education` (a list of `{school, degree, fieldOfStudy, startYear, endYear}`, `endYear` 0 meaning ongoing), `yearsOfExperience` (career span in years, computed from the earliest dated experience; 0 if none), and the full `experiences` work history (each `{title, companyName, companyUrn, companyUniversalName, startYear, startMonth, endYear, location}`, `endYear` 0 meaning current) plus `currentCompany` in the same shape for the present role. These read over the same logged-in Voyager cookie/CSRF path as the rest of the profile and are best-effort when hidden or rate-limited.

**LinkedIn profile visit warm-up:** `wonda linkedin visit <vanity-or-url> --account <name>` is WAB-only and intentionally separate from `wonda linkedin profile`. `profile` is a stealth data read and does not fire viewed-your-profile. `visit` opens the real `/in/<vanity>/` page in the persona browser, dwells for roughly 6-20s by default, makes a light scroll pass unless `--no-scroll` is set, and returns `{ ok, status, profile, dwellMs, scrolled }`. Private or anonymous LinkedIn profile-viewing settings can suppress the target notification.

**LinkedIn account creation:** `wonda linkedin signup` provisions a brand-new LinkedIn account: it mints a throwaway mailbox (or uses `--email`), drives the join flow (email plus password, name, emailed verification code, profile) in a headful WAB window, fetches the verification PIN from the inbox, then binds the persona and syncs cookies so LinkedIn reads and writes route through the new account. Gated by the `linkedinAccountCreationEnabled` flag (server-evaluated preflight: `GET /linkedin/signup/enabled`). Bind a mobile or residential proxy to the persona first (`wonda wab config set <persona> proxy_url socks5://...`): LinkedIn shadowbans accounts born on datacenter IPs even harder than Reddit. LinkedIn frequently inserts a captcha or "security verification" puzzle the flow cannot pass automatically; when a field cannot be located the flow pauses and leaves the window on that screen, so finish by hand then re-run with `--resume <step>` (`account|name|code|profile|persist`). On success it prints `{name, email, password, persona, account}` plus a ready-to-paste `op item create` block for the "LinkedIn logins" vault.

**Connection request modes:** The `connect` command has two transports:

- **`--via cookies` (API):** Voyager REST API with fingerprint mitigations (profile visit, drawer warm-up, connect). Fast (~3s), supports notes via `customMessage`.
- **`--via wab`:** Routes through the account's persona Chromium (auto-spawned) for full stealth via DOM dispatch. Zero fingerprinting risk. Slower (~10s) but fully safe. Use when you need extra protection. The stealth browser + Chromium install once via `wonda wab install` (~315 MB, idempotent). The persona reuses its persistent profile under `~/.wonda/wab/personas/<persona>/profile`. Cookies live in `~/.wonda/linkedin-cookies/<account>.json`, bound to the persona via `account-bindings.json`; rotating via `wonda linkedin auth set --account <name>` pushes the new cookies into the live Chromium if it's running.

**Connection request JSON failures:** A failed local WAB connect exits nonzero and writes a structured JSON error to stderr. `error.code` stays `send-rejected` for a genuine one-off rejection. A weekly invitation limit or silent send drop uses `send-throttled` with machine reason `weekly_invitation_limit` or `silent_drop`; HTTP 429 keeps `blocked:rate-limit` with reason `http_429`. Connect failures include `throttled`, and visible UI failures include the original toast in `detail`. With JSON output, a local `--hard` action-budget stop emits `error: "hard-rate-limit"`, `throttled: true`, and `reason: "local_hard_limit"` on stdout while keeping the existing stderr sentence. Cloud-wrapped failures preserve the existing outer HTTP status, `error.code`, and `error.reason`; the raw connect token and reason are additive `error.actionCode` and `error.actionReason` fields.

**LinkedIn InMail:** `wonda linkedin inmail <vanity-or-url> --message <body> [--subject <subject>] [--spend-credit] [--dry-run]` drives LinkedIn's native InMail composer in WAB only. It is not `connect` and not `send-message`; first-degree recipients are refused with a pointer to `wonda linkedin send-message`. Open Profile / free InMail can send without credit confirmation. If LinkedIn indicates one InMail credit will be consumed, the command stops with `sent:false` and exits 0 unless `--spend-credit` is provided (`--yes-consume-credit` still works as a deprecated alias). `--dry-run` fills the composer and stops before Send.

**LinkedIn InMail credit balance:** `wonda linkedin inmail-credits` is read-only and returns the seat's remaining InMail credit balance as `remaining` (plus the grant type and id) from the Sales Navigator credit-grant endpoint over the cookies transport. It never sends anything and never consumes a credit; use it to plan before `wonda linkedin inmail --spend-credit`. It requires an active Sales Navigator seat on the account; flagship-Premium-only accounts cannot read their balance this way.

**LinkedIn public profile enrichment:** `wonda linkedin enrich <profile-url-or-vanity...>` defaults to `--via cookies`, uses the local logged-in profile read path one profile at a time, reuses `_artifacts/linkedin-cache`, adds jitter between misses, aborts on 429-style rate-limit signals, and rejects more than 25 inputs when run directly. The `linkedin_enrich` tool (local MCP and the twin action route) caps a batch `targets` call at 10 instead: that path shares tighter caller-side deadlines (the Go API client's 300s request-cancel, other synchronous HTTP callers) that a 25-profile run could exceed. Both `--via cookies` and `--via wab` include each profile's education (school, degree, fieldOfStudy, startYear, endYear) and derived `yearsOfExperience` in the returned profile, but the education fetch is best-effort: a transient failure of that optional request (anything other than a rate limit) still returns a successful enrichment with no education field, and that result is cached as-is. A cache hit is served as-is, and entries written by commands that share this cache without fetching education (`enrich-engagers`, `search-posts` author profiles), by `enrich` before this change, or by a prior best-effort miss lack education, so pass `--force-refresh` when education matters. `enrich-engagers` does not request education, so its per-engager profile read count is unchanged. Use `--via public` for paid public enrichment through `POST /api/v1/scrape/linkedin-profiles`, polling `GET /api/v1/scrape/linkedin-profiles/{taskId}` until completion unless `--no-wait` is set. Cancel a running paid scrape with `wonda scrape cancel <taskId>`. Public mode supports `--force-refresh`, `--timeout 10m`, `--idempotency-key`, and `--output json|table`. The single-profile `wonda linkedin profile --via public` path uses the same paid route and also supports `--force-refresh`, `--timeout`, and `--idempotency-key`.

- `--via wab` runs the same batch through the persona's Wonda Automation Browser session: every profile read executes inside the logged-in browser (authentic fingerprint, no flat-store staleness). Same 25-input cap, pacing, cache, and education/yearsOfExperience fields as `--via cookies`. Prefer it when a batch follows a Sales Navigator export or when cookie reads have been failing.

**LinkedIn sent invitation tracking:** `wonda linkedin sent-invitations` is read-only and defaults to `--via cookies`. It lists live pending outgoing invites and, by default, reconciles them with the local WAB connect audit to label audited targets as `accepted`, `pending`, `withdrawn`, or `unknown`; pass `--reconcile=false` for the raw paginated pending list or `--no-connection-check` to skip per-target connection-status reads. `--via wab` routes the same reads through the account persona. LinkedIn's sent-list Voyager endpoints currently churn, so the command tries pageable Voyager variants before falling back to the read-only sent-invitations manager page. Results always report `complete`, `fetched`, `knownTotal`, and `source`. `complete` is true only when the inventory is proven complete; `fetched` counts distinct pending rows returned; `knownTotal` is LinkedIn's advertised total or null when absent or inconsistent; and `source` is `voyager` or `html`. HTML fallback results also report `fetchCap`, the rendered HTML row cap; it is omitted when HTML was not used. A partial inventory returns useful rows with `complete: false`. An audited target absent from a partial inventory becomes `unknown` when connection checks are disabled or fail, never an inferred withdrawal. `acceptRate` excludes unknown rows. `--via public` and `--via api` are not supported.

**LinkedIn connection status batches:** `wonda linkedin connection-status <inputs...>` returns exactly one result per input in the original order. Every row includes the exact original `input`. Lookup failures are labeled with `status: "error"` and `error` instead of being dropped. One input keeps the object shape; multiple inputs keep the array shape. A single lookup failure adds the labeled object on stdout while preserving the existing stderr error and nonzero exit.

**Engager enrichment:** `wonda linkedin enrich-engagers --activity-id <id>` scrapes reactors (and optionally commenters via `--comments`), then fetches each engager's profile + current employer + company page, and emits a single joined JSON document keyed by vanity with `profile` and `currentEmployer` (industry, headcount, HQ, description, employee count) blocks per engager. Use `--company-detail=false` to skip company page lookups and keep only inlined employer identity (`name`, `urn`, `universalName`). Use `--max-profiles N` to cap the batch (default 250, hard ceiling 250 unless `--override-max-profiles` is set) and `--out file.json` to write to disk. `--profile-source cookies|public` controls only per-profile detail enrichment; engager collection still uses logged-in LinkedIn access.

For ICP qualification of post engagers, run `wonda skill get linkedin-icp-qualify`.

### Instagram

A first-class platform with three transports selected by `--via`, the same legitimacy gradient as the others:

- `--via api` — official Graph API via your connected OAuth account (`--connection`). ToS-safe, used for publishing.
- `--via cookies` — private mobile API via the local cookie `--account`. Used for reads (saved posts, comments).
- `--via wab` — browser DOM via the account's Wonda Automation Browser persona. Used for the `comment` write (drives the reel's inline comment composer with a real-browser fingerprint, the same stealth path X reply / LinkedIn comment use).

Transports are per-operation capabilities: `saved` and `comments` are cookies-only (no Graph endpoint for them), `post`/`carousel` are api-only, and `comment` is wab-only. The two identities are distinct: `--account`/`--sessionid` = the local cookie identity; `--connection` = the OAuth `instagram_account` UUID. For `--via wab` the persona is auto-derived from `--account` (or pass `--persona` directly); the WAB injects the bound account's `sessionid` (+ `ds_user_id`) into the Chromium cookie jar at spawn.

> ⚠️ **Same anti-fraud caution as the others: don't probe freshly-pasted cookies.** The first request on a new `sessionid` should be the operation you wanted. Instagram flags burst activity from a new IP/process on a freshly-handed session.

```bash
# Auth setup — local cookie identity (run `wonda instagram auth --help` for details)
wonda instagram auth set --sessionid <value>                # Just the sessionid cookie (simplest)
wonda instagram auth set --cookies "$(pbpaste)"             # Full DevTools cookie: header (also captures ds_user_id)
wonda instagram auth set --account <name> --sessionid <v>   # Multi-account
wonda instagram auth set --account <name> --sessionid <v> --persona <persona>  # Also bind to a WAB persona

# Read (cookies)
wonda instagram saved                                       # Your saved posts (--all to walk all pages)
wonda instagram saved --jq '.posts[] | {authorHandle, url}' # Project fields out of the result
wonda instagram comments https://instagram.com/reel/<code>/ # A post/reel's comments (--all to walk all pages)
wonda instagram comments <code> --jq '.comments[] | {authorHandle, text}'  # Bare shortcode also works

# Publish (--via api, default — the official Graph API via your connected account)
wonda instagram post --media <media-id> --caption "Hello"   # Single image/reel
wonda instagram post --media <id> --connection <ig-uuid>    # Pick the connected account explicitly
wonda instagram carousel --media <id1> --media <id2>        # 2-10 image carousel

# Comment on a reel (--via wab only — drives the inline composer in the WAB)
wonda instagram comment https://instagram.com/reel/<code>/ "Great reel!" --persona my-account
wonda instagram comment <code> "Love this" --persona my-account   # Bare shortcode also works

# Feed-engage (--via wab only: scroll the home feed and like target authors' posts)
wonda instagram feed-engage --authors "a,b" --duration 5m --persona my-account  # Scroll the feed and like posts from these authors (wab-only)
```

`--account` selects the cookie file under `~/.wonda/instagram-cookies/<account>.json`. For `saved`, carousels contribute every child's media URL (videos win over images for the per-item URL); pagination uses the `max_id` cursor (`--cursor`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`). `comments` takes a `/p/<code>/` or `/reel/<code>/` URL (or a bare shortcode), decodes it to the numeric media id locally, then pages the same `max_id` cursor; the result carries each comment's `id`, `text`, `authorHandle`, `authorName`, `createdAt`, `likeCount`, `replyCount` plus the parent media's total `commentCount`. For posting, `wonda instagram post --via api` and `wonda publish instagram` share the same Graph-API path. `comment` (write) takes a `/reel/<code>/` or `/p/<code>/` URL (or bare shortcode) plus the text, and is wab-only: it auto-spawns the persona's WAB if needed, types into the inline composer, submits, and writes a `comment` audit row to `~/.wonda/wab/audit.jsonl` (failures fire `wab_action_failed` telemetry and drop a failure bundle).

### Reddit

Reddit's transport is fixed per command kind, so `--via` is mostly not yours to choose here:

- **Reads** (search, subreddit, feed, user, user-posts, user-comments, post, trending, home, saved) run direct via a Chrome-fingerprinted Go HTTP client (fast, ~700ms p50). Cookies only. `--via wab` is not available for reads and errors.
- **Writes** (vote, comment, subscribe, save, unsave, delete, and subreddit `submit`) dispatch through the account's Wonda Automation Browser so the shreddit GraphQL mutations carry a real-browser signal. WAB only. `--via cookies` errors on these.
- **Submit to a profile self-post** (`u_<handle>` / `u/<handle>`) **or a link post** goes via the tls-client (cookies) only. `--via wab` is not available for those (no DOM submit URL), so `--dry-run` (DOM-only) does not apply to them either.

`--account` selects the cookie file under `~/.wonda/reddit-cookies/` (and, for writes, the account's auto-derived persona). You don't pass a persona here.

> ⚠️ **Anti-fraud caution on freshly-pasted cookies.** `wonda reddit auth check` is safe (it only decodes the JWT exp locally), but the FIRST read or write you fire on new cookies hits Reddit's API from your IP / process. If those cookies were last used elsewhere (different machine, different country), Reddit's anti-fraud trips the session-theft heuristic and may force-logout the cookies. Pattern: paste cookies, go straight to the operation the user wanted. Never do a "let me just check this works" round-trip first.

```bash
# Auth setup (run `wonda reddit auth --help` for details)
wonda reddit auth set --cookies "$(pbpaste)"                         # Paste full DevTools cookie: header
wonda reddit auth set --account <name>-1 --cookies "$(pbpaste)"      # Multi-account

# Account creation (wab-only, flagged: redditAccountCreationEnabled)
wonda reddit signup --persona <name> --random                                       # Create a brand-new account end-to-end
wonda reddit signup --persona <name> --email <addr> --username <handle> --password <pw>
wonda reddit signup --persona <name> --resume credentials                           # Resume after a manual step
```

`wonda reddit user` includes additive `emails` and `links` fields when the user has published explicit contact details in their public About text. These fields are read-only and equivalent to manually reading the profile. No inferred emails, enrichment data, storage, or DOM scraping is involved.

Add `--dry-run` on a subreddit `comment` or `submit` to type into the composer but not click Post (useful for review). It is DOM-only, so it does not apply to profile self-posts or link posts. For subreddit submits, pass `--flair "<label>"` to select post flair in the composer. Flair labels match case-insensitively with normalized whitespace, first by exact label and then by contains fallback. If a subreddit requires flair and it is omitted, or if the requested flair does not exist, the command fails with the available flair labels. `--flair` is not supported with profile self-posts or `--url` link posts.

`wonda reddit signup` provisions a brand-new Reddit account: it mints a throwaway mailbox (or uses `--email`), drives the 5-stage register form (email, emailed code, username plus password, age, interests) in a headful WAB window, fetches the verification code from the inbox subject line, then binds the persona and syncs cookies so reddit reads and writes route through the new account. Gated by the `redditAccountCreationEnabled` flag (server-evaluated preflight: `GET /reddit/signup/enabled`). Bind a mobile or residential proxy to the persona first (`wonda wab config set <persona> proxy_url socks5://...`): Reddit shadowbans accounts born on datacenter IPs. If a field cannot be located the flow pauses and leaves the window on that screen; finish by hand, then re-run with `--resume <step>`. On success it prints `{username, email, password, persona}` plus a ready-to-paste `op item create` block for the "Reddit logins" vault.

Paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--after <cursor>`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

**Feed-engage author mode** (`wonda {linkedin,x,reddit,instagram} feed-engage`): scroll the home feed like a human and engage only the posts that scroll past from your target authors. On reddit that engagement is an upvote, on the others a like. It is WAB-only (it drives a live browser scroll + click through the account's persona, so there is no cookie path) and opportunistic: it never opens profiles or searches, it just rides the feed and acts when a target's post appears. Pass the targets with `--authors "alice,bob"` (comma-separated handles/vanities/usernames, leading `@` and `u/` are stripped) or `--authors-file <path>` (one author per line, local use only). `--duration` caps the wall-clock browse time (e.g. `5m`, `90s`, default `2m`) and `--max-engage` caps the number of successful likes/upvotes (default `8`); whichever limit hits first stops the run. Pacing is human (eased scrolling, randomized dwell, jittered cursor motion), so let it run for the full duration rather than expecting an instant result.

LinkedIn author mode can also opt into comment reactions with `--engage-comments`: by default it reacts only to comments from `--authors`, `--engage-comments-from any` includes all visible comments, and `--max-comment-engage` caps comment reactions per engaged post (default `3`).

**LinkedIn engage-commenters** (`wonda linkedin engage-commenters`): read commenters on one LinkedIn post, then run the selected per-commenter actions in order: `like`, `reply`, `connect`. Pass the post with `--post <activity-id|urn|url>`. `--actions` accepts `like,reply,connect` and defaults to `like`; `--reply-text` is required when `reply` is selected; `--connect-note` is optional; `--max-commenters` defaults to `25`; `--duration` defaults to `3m`; `--dry-run` resolves targets and opens controls/composers without submitting writes. Access tier: paid/WAB. Transport: commenter reads use the established LinkedIn DOM comments path; every write uses WAB DOM primitives.

**Feed-engage monitor mode** (`wonda {linkedin,x,reddit} feed-engage --keywords ...`): run one bounded keyword/intent monitor pass, score unseen candidates with `/text/generate`, and optionally generate persona replies with `/text/generate`. `--keywords` enables monitor mode and is mutually exclusive with `--authors` and `--authors-file`. Reddit supports `--subreddits SaaS,marketing` to scope search. Without `--reply`, monitor mode is read-only and prints candidates plus relevance verdicts. With `--reply --dry-run`, it generates reply text but posts nothing and leaves the ledger unchanged. With `--reply`, it posts through DOM/WAB writers only: Reddit comment composer, X reply composer, and LinkedIn comment composer. Reads use cookies/tls-client where available: Reddit search and X search use the platform clients; LinkedIn content search uses the existing WAB DOM `search-posts` flow because LinkedIn content search is not reliable through the cookie API. Safety controls: `--max-scan` (default 50), `--relevance-threshold` (default 0.7), `--max-reply` (default 3), `--per-day-cap` (default 8), and a persistent dedupe ledger under `~/.wonda/reply-ledger/`. Generated public replies are post-processed to remove em dashes. Monitor mode is not supported for Instagram.

### Cross-platform DM coverage

| Platform | Read inbox | Read conversation | Send existing thread | Start or cold-DM                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn | Yes        | Yes               | Yes                  | Yes, via profile/message flow      |
| Reddit   | Yes        | Yes               | Yes                  | Yes, via `wonda reddit chat start` |
| X        | Yes        | Yes               | Yes                  | Yes, via `wonda x dm start`        |

### Reddit chat / DMs

Direct messaging through the WAB. Chat uses the logged-in Reddit browser session
and is available as first-class twin actions with `--via wab`. There is no
separate chat token.

```bash
# Read
wonda reddit chat inbox                                  # List DM conversations with latest messages
wonda reddit chat messages <room-id> -n 50               # Fetch messages from a room

# Write
wonda reddit chat start <username> --text "Hey!"         # Start (or reuse) a DM with a user by username (no room-id needed)
wonda reddit chat send <room-id> --text "Hey!"           # Send a DM into an existing room (mimics browser typing behavior)

# Management
wonda reddit chat accept-all                             # Accept all pending chat requests
```

**Important**: Rate limit DM sends to 15-20/day with varied text to avoid detection. The `send` command drives the browser composer and verifies the rendered message.

### Cloud digital twins (`wonda twin`)

Manage cloud-hosted social personas that run behind mobile proxies. Sessions are server-side; schedules drive recurring tasks (saved-content sync, engagement, agent runs) on a cron.

**Interactive (watchable) vs headless: know which surface you are on.** A cloud twin runs the SAME antidetect Chromium two ways, and only some of them stream a live screen you (or the user) can watch and click into:

- **Watchable, interactive surfaces (a live cloud browser streamed to a `viewerUrl` you open in the local WAB or any browser):** `wonda twin login`, `wonda twin view`, `wonda twin signup`, and `wonda twin attach`. Use these whenever a human must SEE and DRIVE the cloud browser: sign in, re-authenticate, create a brand-new account, or solve anything a human has to touch. `login`/`view`/`signup` START a fresh run and take the twin's profile lease; `attach` is different — it hooks onto an ALREADY-running run by its `<runId>` (from `wonda twin runs`) and NEVER takes the lease, so an operator can watch (or take control of) ANY live run on demand — an autopilot run, a schedule firing, a `run-now` command — not only a session they just started. A CAPTCHA (or any step-up challenge) can only be solved on one of these watchable surfaces. You cannot type credentials or solve a captcha for the user; hand them the `viewerUrl` and let them finish, then re-check `wonda twin login-status` / `health` / `liveness`.
- **Headless surfaces (no screen, no viewer, unattended):** `wonda twin run-now`, schedules, `wonda twin login-status`, `wonda twin seed-from-cookies`, and every platform action run with `--engine cloud`. These run invisibly behind the proxy; nobody is watching. If one hits a captcha or a login wall it cannot be solved in place, so the run just FAILS (fetch its `wonda twin artifact <runId>` screenshot to see why), OR — while it is still live — you `wonda twin attach <runId> --control --open` to jump into it and drive it yourself, then let it continue.
- **To take control of a live run, use `wonda twin attach <runId> --control`.** There is no `wonda twin control` verb; drive-capable control of an arbitrary live run happens through `attach --control` (or, for a view you started, `wonda twin view`). `attach` without `--control` is a read-only watcher.
- **Watching / screenshotting a streamed viewer (agents): use the WAB, never a bare Playwright or headless-Chromium script.** `login`/`view`/`signup` open the viewer as a tab INSIDE the local WAB; that tab IS the observation surface, so `wonda wab show <persona>` surfaces the window and `wonda wab screenshot <persona>` captures a PNG without surfacing it. For a read-only `attach` capture, omit both `--control` and `--open`, then run `wonda wab screenshot <viewerUrl> --output run.png --wait-until domcontentloaded --wait-for '#screen[width][height]'`. The attach viewer adds `width` and `height` attributes to `#screen` only after its first streamed image has loaded into the canvas, so this waits for real frame content instead of merely waiting for the viewer shell or idle network. The broker fans frames out to multiple read-only viewers, so this screenshot can run alongside other viewers. Only control is single-winner: if several controller-role viewers connect, the first keeps control and later ones are demoted to view-only. First confirm the run is actually streaming (`wonda twin liveness <persona>` → `live:true`) before building any observer at all.

`wonda twin login-automated` is NOT a headless happy path. The route never finishes a login on its own; it ALWAYS mints a streamed-login fallback and returns `{ status: "needs_human", viewerUrl }`. Treat it as "open this `viewerUrl` and sign in by hand", the same as `twin login`.

Two gotchas that cause false "it's running / it's signed in" reports:

- **`--engine cloud` parks a warm control session that holds a ~15-min busy lease.** After a cloud action the twin stays "busy" for the idle window, so a following `twin login`/`view`/`signup` (or another `--engine cloud` action) can 409 as busy until the lease decays. This is expected warm-session behavior, not a bug; wait it out or `wonda twin stop <persona>`.
- **The "You are now signed in" panel in the viewer is sticky.** It confirms the login WAS detected in that session; it does NOT mean a live stream is open now. For "is a live interactive stream open THIS SECOND" use `wonda twin liveness <persona>` (flips false ~30s after the tab closes); for run state use `wonda twin runs` / `wonda twin health`. Never infer "still running / still watching" from the sticky panel.

The MCP twin surface tags read tools as Always allow and write tools as Needs approval. Use `run_campaign` and `schedule_loop` for one-approval autopilot loops; use the per-verb platform tools for supervised actions.

Claude web and Cowork users can connect the cloud twin as a custom remote MCP connector from https://wonda.sh/docs/connect-claude.

Signing in re-authenticates the twin and flips it back to active. Prints the viewer URL (served at <web-base>/twin-login.html, token in the URL fragment) so you can open it in any browser too.

A fresh persona is provisioned automatically; signup REFUSES to run over an already-active/needs-auth twin (use `twin login` to re-authenticate). It completes only when you press the Done action AND the cloud confirms the new account (session cookie set, no unresolved challenge); the created handle is then bound to the twin and the profile snapshots active. Unmetered. (--platform <x|linkedin|reddit|instagram>, --web-base default https://wonda.sh)
wonda twin signup <persona> --automated                  # Reddit only: the cloud AUTO-DRIVES the register form (mailbox, emailed code, username, password) up to the date-of-birth step, then PAUSES and shows a Resume banner in the stream. You type the DOB by hand (the automation struggles with Reddit's segmented birthday widget), then click Resume and the cloud finishes the remaining steps + saves. Add --dob YYYY-MM-DD to pre-fill the age step too (leaving only a challenge/onboarding for you). Needs redditAccountCreationEnabled + emailServerApiEnabled for the account. Platform is pinned to reddit.
wonda twin attach <run-id>                               # Attach a live VIEWER to an already-running twin run (run id from `wonda twin runs`). Unlike login/view/signup it does NOT start a run or take the profile lease: it registers read-only presence on the LIVE run and prints a browser-openable viewer URL so an operator can watch any live run (autopilot / schedule / run-now) on demand. Add --open to launch the viewer in your default browser. Add --control to attach as a drive-capable CONTROLLER (click/type into the live run) instead of a read-only watcher. 404 if the run is unknown/not yours; run_not_live if it is not live; run_not_attachable if it is a batch job that cannot stream. Unmetered; needs Premium (cloud twin).

# Sharing (owner-only: a grantee can never re-share a twin granted to them)
wonda twin share add <persona> --email <email>           # Share a CLOUD twin with another Wonda account (they must already have one; unknown email -> 404 "ask them to sign up first"). Exactly one of --email or --org. --role operator (default) | read-only. Emails them by default; --no-notify grants silently. Needs Premium (cloud twin). Sharing with yourself -> 400; an existing live grant -> 409. If the notification fails the grant STILL succeeded: the response carries emailSent:false and the CLI warns on stderr, exit 0.
wonda twin share add <persona> --org <orgId> --role read-only   # Share with every member of an organization instead of one account. --no-notify is rejected here (an org share has nobody to email).
wonda twin share list <persona>                          # Who this twin is shared with: share id, grantee email (or org), role, createdAt. Owner-only (a grantee gets 403). NOT Premium-gated, so a lapsed owner can still audit access.
wonda twin share rm <share-id>                           # Revoke a share (id from `twin share list`). Owner-only; a share that is not yours -> 404 (never leaks that it exists). NOT Premium-gated, so a lapsed owner can always cut off access they granted.

# Using a twin someone shared WITH you: there is no separate surface. Address it by
# persona name through the normal twin/platform commands (`wonda twin show <persona>`,
# `wonda twin run-now <persona>`, `linkedin ... --account <persona>`); the server
# resolves a bare persona to your own twin first, else to a live grant.
#   - role operator drives the twin (login, view, run-now, actions); read-only reads metadata only.
#   - Owner-only routes stay denied even to an operator: `twin export-cookies` and rewriting the alert-webhook secret.
#   - A grantee can NEVER drive a home:local twin (it lives on the owner's machine), only home:cloud.
#   - If two different owners share the SAME persona name with you, the request is denied as ambiguous rather than guessed. Ask one of them to rename.
#   - Both sides need Premium: the twin routes check YOUR cloud-twin entitlement, and cloud dispatch also checks the OWNER's (their account pays for the run).

### Local WAB relay (`wonda relay`)

Run registered twin actions on this machine's local WAB while callers still use the cloud broker and the same `/twin/sessions/{persona}/actions/{platform}/{action}` API.

`relay health` and `relay restart` require Wonda CLI v1.57.0 or newer. Before calling either command, check `wonda --version`. On an older or unknown version, do not attempt the unavailable command: use `wonda doctor --relay` instead of `relay health`. Do not substitute `relay install` for `relay restart`, because reinstalling without every configured `--persona` can replace the relay's persona set. Report that a safe CLI restart requires v1.57.0+ and ask the user to upgrade when that release is available.

```bash
wonda relay pair                                        # Pair this machine with your Wonda account using the existing browser login flow
wonda relay run --persona <p>                           # Long-poll the cloud broker and serve actions for a persona
wonda relay status --persona <p>                        # Show local relay configuration
wonda relay health                                      # v1.57.0+. One-line verdict for this machine's relay: state (connected|standby|degraded|offline) + reason (ok, standby, not-installed, not-running, waiting-for-sign-in, hook-unreachable, unpaired, bootstrapping, browser-bootstrap-failed, broker-disconnected, broker-unreachable, broker-unknown, self-update-failed, version-mismatch, version-blocked). `standby` means the relay is healthy here but another of the account's devices is the active one, so this machine serves nothing until the user picks Make active on the setup page: working as designed, not a fault. `waiting-for-sign-in` is a Windows box with the task registered and nobody signed in: expected, not a fault, so do not report it as a failure. `hook-unreachable` is a live relay process whose loopback status hook cannot be read (custom --local-hook-port, or the standard ports taken): the relay may well be serving, only unobservable locally. The JSON also carries `serving` (true|false|absent) mirroring the relay's own poll answer; absent means unknown (old relay or backend, or the last poll failed), never standby. `version-blocked` means the server's version policy refuses NEW actions from this relay until it updates (it can still report serving=true, so blocked outranks green) + summary/detail/hint, plus running/paired/supervised, version, personas, connected/disconnected, logPath. Branch on `reason`, never on the message. The macOS menu-bar dot's FORENSIC tier: the dot's steady-state poll reads the relay's loopback /status over HTTP directly (no CLI spawn) and only fast-classifies a healthy current-binary serving/standby payload; this command runs on HTTP silence, on state transitions, after user actions, AND keeps recurring at the 15s throttle for as long as the payload cannot be fast-classified (a sustained fault such as unpaired / bootstrapping / blocked / version drift, or an old relay that does not report `serving`), because the forensic verdict is then the dot's only source of state. Recurring `relay health` subprocesses during a persistent fault are therefore expected, not a bug; only the healthy steady states are spawn-free. `wonda doctor --relay` prints the same facts check by check
wonda relay restart                                     # v1.57.0+. Restart the installed relay. macOS: `launchctl kickstart -k` when launchd already supervises this binary, else falls back to the full `relay install` path (rewrites the plist, bootstraps it). Windows: re-registers and restarts the Scheduled Task. Preserves the personas the autostart already serves unless you pass --persona
wonda relay stop --persona <p>                          # Clear cloud relay presence for a persona (this does NOT stop the local relay process; use `wonda relay disable` to stop it, `wonda relay restart` to bounce it, or `wonda relay uninstall` to remove the autostart)
wonda relay disable                                     # Stop the running relay AND turn its autostart off persistently, so nothing brings it back until `relay enable`/`app open`. macOS: launchctl bootout + a persistent launchctl disable (survives KeepAlive and the next login). Windows: schtasks /End + stop the relay processes /End leaves behind + /Change /DISABLE (survives logon triggers and restart-on-failure). Both also stop a relay started by hand with `relay run` in any supported spelling (the `relay start` alias, inherited flags in either legal position; this user's only) and verify the outcome: the command fails instead of reporting a stop that did not happen. Keeps the plist/task, so the personas survive for re-enable. This is the process-level stop; `relay stop` is the unrelated broker-presence clear
wonda relay enable                                      # Inverse of disable. macOS: clears the launchd disable override FIRST (a disabled service refuses to bootstrap), then takes the cheapest path that ends with a running relay: an already-supervised relay with a live pid is left alone, a correctly loaded job with no live pid (KeepAlive backoff, manual `launchctl stop`) gets a plain kickstart (mode "kickstart", no plist rewrite), and every other state reruns the full install path (rewrite plist + bootstrap; mode "reinstall"). Windows: schtasks /Change /ENABLE, then a live-relay pid check before /Run: a relay that is already running, whether the task's own instance or one started by hand with `relay run` (which the task's IgnoreNew policy cannot see), is left alone, and only a machine with no live relay gets /Run; an unregistered task is installed fresh. Preserves the installed personas, like `relay restart`
wonda relay install [--persona <p>]                     # Install the relay to auto-start at login and stay running. macOS: LaunchAgent (restarts on crash, logs to ~/Library/Logs/wonda-relay.log). Windows: per-user Scheduled Task launched through a hidden VBScript wrapper (logon trigger + restart-on-failure, no admin, no password, no console window). Re-run to point autostart at a new binary. A Homebrew Cellar path is auto-rewritten to the stable opt symlink so brew cleanup can't delete the target. The .pkg and Windows installer run this for the installing console user; CLI-only channels (brew formula, npm, install.sh) get it via `wonda app install` (install.sh offers that interactively; brew/npm only PRINT the pointer, because package hooks cannot run setup: pnpm 10/Bun block lifecycle scripts and npm v12 disables them by default). A one-time nudge also points interactive CLI use at `wonda app install` on machines with neither the app nor the relay autostart (TTY-only, never in CI, once per machine via a ~/.wonda marker). Package managers have no uninstall hooks, so the clean removal order is `wonda app quit` FIRST, then brew/npm uninstall; an orphaned at-login mechanism left by skipping that is inert (silent no-op at login, no error spam). Headless/MDM pkg installs and additional Mac users run `wonda relay install` or `wonda app open` once themselves
wonda relay uninstall                                   # Remove the relay autostart. macOS: stop the LaunchAgent and delete its plist. Windows: delete the Scheduled Task and its VBScript wrapper
wonda app install [--release <tag>]                     # The bridge from a CLI-only install (brew formula, npm, curl) to the full desktop experience: downloads THIS CLI version's signed installer from the releases (macOS: notarized wonda-macos.pkg; Windows: wonda-windows-setup.exe), verifies its SHA-256 against the release's checksums.txt (a missing entry is a hard failure, never an unverified run), and runs it. macOS: `sudo installer -pkg ... -target /` with the normal sudo prompt, then continues into `app open`; Windows: launches the setup program DETACHED and exits (the installer kills running wonda.exe processes to free the image, this one included, and finishes the whole setup itself). Idempotent: the exact version already installed (macOS: pkgutil receipt for sh.wonda.cli; Windows: the Add/Remove Programs record) offers a reinstall, default no. Without a TTY it prints the download URL and manual steps instead of running anything. Dev builds skip with a message; the hidden --release <tag> installs a specific release (the live-test seam). Exempt from the minimum-version gate: a version-blocked CLI must be able to fetch the current installer, which is the remedy for its own condition. First-run nudge: an interactive CLI on a machine with neither the app nor the relay autostart prints one pointer at this command, once ever (marker in ~/.wonda), never in CI or scripts
wonda app open                                          # Desktop-app open, what /Applications/Wonda.app (macOS; a tiny shim that runs ONE fixed path: the pkg's root-owned payload CLI under /Library/Application Support/Wonda; no per-user or PATH fallback, so no cross-user swap surface, while the relay itself is still handed to your verified self-updating ~/.wonda binary by the Go side) and the Start Menu "Wonda" entry (Windows; a hidden VBS launcher the installer writes) run: heal + enable the relay autostart (healthy relay not bounced), register Wonda to come back at login, and show the tray icon. macOS login mechanism: an Open at Login entry (System Settings > General > Login Items) pointing at /Applications/Wonda.app; with that app not installed (a CLI-only machine), a terminal run OFFERS to fetch it via the `app install` flow (y/N, default no; never a silent download), and otherwise the entry is skipped and reported (`loginItem: skipped-app-not-installed`, plus an `appInstallHint`). Windows: writes a hidden Startup-folder launcher (wonda-startup.vbs, per-user, runs `wonda app open` at sign-in, silent no-op if wonda.exe is gone) rewritten on every open, so a later NSIS install repoints the same file (never duplicates); the relay's Scheduled Task keeps its own logon trigger independently. Idempotent, and serialized: concurrent opens cannot stack tray icons or login items. PARTIAL-SUCCESS EXIT CONTRACT: `app open` exits 0 even when a sub-step fails (it launches from Finder or the Start Menu with no terminal; the tray badge is the failure surface), reporting failures in the JSON result as `relayError`, `loginItemError`, `appInstallError`, `startupEntryError`, or `trayError`. Automation must inspect those fields, never the exit code alone
wonda app quit                                          # Desktop-app quit, what the tray's "Quit Wonda" runs: `relay disable` (verified, incl. a hand-run `relay run`) + remove every come-back-at-login mechanism + remove the icon. macOS: deletes the Open at Login entry for the Wonda app, verified by enumeration (the script deletes every entry for the path and returns how many remain): an entry that survives removal fails quit non-zero with the fix, icon left up to say why, and cannot wedge (deleting the entry in System Settings makes the next quit succeed). With NO app bundle on disk the System Events call is skipped entirely (`loginItem: skipped-app-not-installed`), sparing CLI-only machines the Automation prompt (an entry pointing at a missing app is inert at login). Windows: deletes the Startup-folder launcher, and a launcher that cannot be removed (beyond already-absent) fails quit non-zero with the fix, because it would reopen Wonda at the next sign-in. One documented blind spot: with the macOS Automation permission denied, entries can be neither removed nor counted, so quit completes, reports `loginItemError` plus a note, and any Open at Login entry that exists WILL reopen Wonda at the next login until removed by hand in System Settings > General > Login Items. Personas and sign-in are kept. Clean uninstall order: `wonda app quit`, THEN brew/npm uninstall (they have no uninstall hooks of their own; the NSIS uninstaller does its own cleanup)
```

The relay runs on your real device and IP. Platform cookies stay local. It only serves actions while the machine and `wonda relay run` are up. If no live relay is present, the broker routes the same twin action call to the cloud twin instead.

**Safety is intrinsic to running anything on a twin.** Account safety is not a special feature of the sequencer: it is a property of "run a command on a twin." The SAME per-identity safety gate guards an ad-hoc agent (`wonda linkedin connect --account <name>`), the autopilot, a `twin schedule`, and a user-authored sequence, through ONE enforcement path against ONE shared per-identity counter. So a heavy ad-hoc day on a persona tightens the headroom on that persona automatically (one set of ceilings per identity, no double-charge). The caps are a per-twin MODE (warmup / conservative_steady (default) / moderate_max / unlimited; set via `wonda twin limits set`) selecting the per-action daily ceilings, the per-action rolling-7d weekly ceilings, AND a global daily aggregate cap; `unlimited` turns every cap off, and a custom override is UNCLAMPED. The gate classifies each command from its argv: WRITE / social-action commands (connect, send-message, like, comment, visit, ...) are capped; reads (connection-status, conversations, profile, search), generation (image/video/text), and unknown commands pass freely ungated. This is why the SENSE verbs exist: an agent asks `can-act` / `actions` / `health` BEFORE firing, then branches on the typed result instead of attempting a write and catching a deny.

### General sequences (MCP and public API)

A sequence is a durable Wonda workflow, not an outreach campaign. It has exactly four composable step kinds:

- `run`: one real Wonda argv. The generated CLI manifest validates command paths, nested Sales Navigator/X DM/Reddit chat verbs, long flags and positional arity.
- `wait`: exact or ranged spacing such as `2h ± 15m` or `3m-9m`, sampled deterministically.
- `if`: ordinary conditions over `{{vars.*}}`, earlier `{{steps.<id>.*}}` results and current-item bindings. AND has normal precedence over OR.
- `each`: sequential bounded fan-out over any array, with `{{item}}` and an optional alias. Default 500 items, explicit maximum 5,000.

Use the MCP tools `sequence_validate`, `sequence_create`, `sequence_run`, `sequence_runs`, `sequence_update`, `sequence_cancel_run` and `sequence_schedule`. Validate before create. Every required `{{vars.*}}` value is checked before a manual or scheduled run is created. Scheduling is optional and accepts either a validated 5-field cron plus IANA timezone or a one-shot instant, deterministic jitter, stored vars, and explicit `allowOverlap` (default false).

Relay execution is manifest-driven, not registry-limited: every generated LinkedIn, Sales Navigator, X and Reddit command can run on the paired machine, including local-only commands such as X DMs. `transport: auto` falls back from a Premium cloud preference to relay when a definition requires one of those local-only commands. Each run snapshots its definition, resolved transport, organization billing scope and trigger, so edits or context changes never rewrite work already in flight.

**Uniform error taxonomy (branch on `code`, never on the message).** Every twin/outreach surface returns the existing `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope, and on a quota deny it also carries `deferUntil` (the ISO time the quota resets) + `reason` (the granular gate signal). Agents branch on the typed `code`:

| `code`                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | What the agent should do                                                                                                                      |

`wonda twin can-act` returns the SAME `code` + `reason` for a deny that a later write would, so an agent that reads `code: "needs_auth"` from `can-act` and then sees `needs_auth` on a write branches on the one code.

### Calendar (`wonda calendar`)

One read-only feed over two things that otherwise have to be checked separately: upcoming twin schedule fires, and past runs and platform actions. Resolved in a real timezone, so "Tuesday" means the user's Tuesday.

```bash
wonda calendar                                              # This civil month, in the detected machine IANA timezone (UTC fallback)
wonda calendar --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 --timezone Europe/Paris
wonda calendar --all                                        # Include days with nothing on them
wonda calendar day 2026-07-24 --timezone Europe/Paris --limit 200
```

A range returns per-day COUNTS only; `calendar day` returns the individual entries. That split is deliberate: a busy account has tens of thousands of rows in a month and a month grid only ever shows counts.

Two axes that must never be added together: `counts.run` is twin runs, `actions` is rows in the source-neutral action ledger. One run performs many platform actions, and an action run on the user's own machine through the relay performs no cloud run at all. Under-reporting is stated rather than implied: `truncated.scheduleFires` means a schedule's fire enumeration hit its ceiling, so those counts are a floor.

## Workflow & discovery

### Brand extraction (`brand extract`)

Extract a website's design system (colors, typography, radii, shadows, spacing, fonts, logo, hero decor, CSS pattern backgrounds, dashed/dotted border treatments, `:root` custom properties, headline emphasis pattern, film-grain/noise overlay) into a `DESIGN.md` + `tokens.json` + `assets/`. Runs locally via the bundled stealth browser + Chromium driver (the same `wonda wab install` as `wonda wab record` and the authenticated session flows).

Requires a one-time `wonda wab install` to download the stealth browser + Chromium (~300 MB, shared across `wonda wab record`, the authenticated session flows, and `brand extract`).

This is the in-house replacement for the previous `npx`-based brand-extraction CLI used in the `slide-generation` / `creative-static-ads` / `premium-static-ads` skills.

```bash
# Local-only — no auth, no credits, no API call
wonda brand extract https://linear.app                       # Writes ./output/linear.app/{DESIGN.md, tokens.json, assets/}
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --output ./refs       # Writes ./refs/stripe.com/...
wonda brand extract https://vercel.com --screenshot          # Also writes page.png
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --viewport 1440x900   # Override default 1920x1080

# Persist to the server (uploads assets via media presign + POSTs /brand/save)
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --save                # Local + persist
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --save --make-active  # Local + persist + activate (the common path)
wonda brand extract https://stripe.com --no-output --save    # Don't write to disk, persist only

# Move a persisted brand around
wonda brand save --from ./output/stripe.com --make-active    # Persist a previously-extracted dir
wonda brand pull <brand-id>                                  # Download a saved brand back to ./output/<domain>/
```

Flags:

- `--save`: upload `assets/` via the media presign flow and POST `{tokens, mediaIds}` to `/api/v1/brand/save`. Requires auth.
- `--make-active`: implies `--save`. Sets the new brand as active.
- `--output <dir>`: override the local output dir. Default is `./output/<domain>/`. Mutually exclusive with `--no-output`.
- `--no-output`: don't write to disk (in-memory extract for piping). Mutually exclusive with `--output`.
- `--name "Brand Name"`: override the brand name when persisting. Defaults to the domain stem capitalized.
- `--screenshot`: also save `page.png` alongside DESIGN.md.
- `--viewport WxH`: viewport size for the headless browser. Default `1920x1080`.

Outputs (when `--no-output` is not set, always to `<output-dir>/<domain>/`):

- `DESIGN.md`: Markdown summary of tokens, typography, hero decor, logo, CSS patterns, dashed borders, and root CSS variables. Read this in the slide / static-ad skills before composing HTML.
- `tokens.json`: raw structured JSON of the extraction.
- `page.png`: only when `--screenshot` is passed.
- `assets/`: raw hero decor files plus `assets/fonts/` for any non-Google `@font-face` URLs. Always written when not `--no-output`.

Prints written file paths to stdout. With `--save`, also prints the API response (`brandId`, `sourceDomain`, `warnings`). Non-zero exit on failure (network error, navigation timeout, browser crash, save failure).

### Video analysis

Analyze a video to extract a composite frame grid (visual) and audio transcript (text). Useful for understanding video content before creating variations. Requires a **full account** (not anonymous) and costs credits based on video duration (ElevenLabs STT pricing).

If the video was just uploaded and is still normalizing, the CLI auto-retries until the media is ready.

```bash
# Analyze a video — returns composite grid image + transcript
ANALYSIS_JOB=$(wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait --quiet)

# The job output contains:
# - compositeGrid: image showing 24 evenly-spaced frames
# - transcript: full text of any speech
# - wordTimestamps: word-level timing [{word, start, end}]
# - videoMetadata: {width, height, durationMs, fps, aspectRatio}

# Download the composite grid for visual inspection
wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait -o /tmp/grid.jpg

# Get just the transcript
wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait --jq '.outputs[] | select(.outputKey=="transcript") | .outputValue'
```

**Error handling**: 402 = insufficient credits, 409 = media still processing (CLI auto-retries).

### Email

Manage throwaway email accounts and read mailbox messages. These commands require the `emailServerApiEnabled` flag.

```bash
wonda email account create [email]                    # Create an email account
wonda email account create --random --domain <domain> # Create an email with a random username
wonda email account create --username <name> --domain <domain> # Create an email with a chosen username
wonda email account get <email>                       # Get email account details
wonda email account delete <email>                    # Delete an email account

wonda email inbox list <email>                        # List inbox messages
wonda email inbox read <email> <id>                   # Read a specific email with verification codes
wonda email inbox wait <email> --timeout 60           # Wait for a new email to arrive
wonda email inbox wait <email> --since "$SINCE"       # Only messages after an RFC 3339 timestamp
wonda email inbox wait <email> --since-id "$MAX_ID"   # Only messages with id greater than this
```

For signup flows, capture `--since` before triggering the verification email, or snapshot the current max message id with `wonda email inbox list <email> --jq '[.[].id] | max // 0'` and pass it to `--since-id`.

### Jobs

```bash
wonda jobs get inference <id>                         # Inference job status
wonda jobs get editor <id>                            # Editor job status
wonda jobs get publish <id>                           # Publish job status
wonda jobs wait inference <id> --timeout 20m          # Wait for completion
```

wonda usage --project acme-launch                     # ...restricted to one project
wonda project list                                    # Spend-tagging projects in the active scope
wonda project create acme-launch                      # Create one (org scope: admin/owner only)
wonda use --project acme-launch                       # Tag subsequent spend with it (sticky)
wonda topup                                            # Top up credits (opens Stripe checkout)
```

### Editing audio & images

```bash
# Edit audio
wonda edit audio --operation <op> --media <id> --wait -o out.mp3
```

For any image edit (crop, text overlay, img2img, background removal, vectorize) pull the dedicated skill: `wonda skill get image-edit`.

### Alignment (timestamp extraction)

```bash
wonda alignment extract-timestamps --model <model> --attach <mediaId> --wait
```

| Sora rejected image              | Person in image                               | Switch to `kling_3_pro`                                |
| Video adds objects not in source | Motion prompt describes elements not in image | Simplify to camera movement and atmosphere only        |
| Text unreadable in video         | AI tried to render text in generation         | Remove text from video prompt, use textOverlay instead |
| Hands look wrong                 | Complex hand actions in prompt                | Simplify to passive positions or frame to exclude      |
| Style inconsistent across series | No shared anchor                              | Use same reference image via `--attach`                |
| Changes to step A not in step B  | Stale render                                  | Re-run all downstream steps                            |

## Error recovery

- **Unknown model**: `wonda models list`
- **No API key**: `wonda auth login` or set `WONDA_API_KEY` env var
- **Job failed**: `wonda jobs get inference <id>` for error details
- **Bad params**: `wonda models info <slug>` for valid params
- **Timeout**: `wonda jobs wait inference <id> --timeout 20m`
- **Insufficient credits (402)**: `wonda topup` to add credits
  LinkedIn WAB attachments: use `linkedin send-message <target> [text] --attach <local-path>` with one supported local file (bmp/gif/jpeg/jpg/png/doc/docx/pdf/mp4/m4a, max 20,000,000 bytes). Add `--dry-run` to stage the upload without sending. Local paths are rejected by cloud mode.
